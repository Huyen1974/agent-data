# CLI Test Count History (for reference):
# CLI140e: 367 → 372 (+5 tests) - Initial implementation
# CLI140e.1: 372 → 375 (+3 tests) - Thread-safe cache
# CLI140e.2: 375 → 377 (+2 tests) - RU optimization
# CLI140e.3: 377 → 393 (+16 tests) - VIOLATION: IAM, latency, retry logic
# CLI140e.3.1: 393 → 393 (+0 tests) - Enforcement action only
# CLI140e.3.2: 393 → 397 (+4 tests) - Temporary adjustment, strict rule for future
# Future CLIs: Must add exactly 1 test each
