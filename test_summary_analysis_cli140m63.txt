BATCH TEST ANALYSIS - CLI140m.63
Test Count: 513 unique tests (collected)
Batches: 171 batches of â‰¤3 tests each
Runtime: ~9 minutes total (~2.7s average per batch)
Status Distribution:
- PASSED: 129 tests
- SKIPPED: 370 tests  
- FAILED: 14 tests
- TIMEOUT: 0 tests (eliminated successfully)
- UNKNOWN: 0 tests (eliminated successfully)

Success: Comprehensive mocking eliminated all timeout and unknown issues.
M1 MacBook Safety: All batches completed under 8s timeout limit.

Key Improvements:
1. Global comprehensive mocking fixture added to conftest.py
2. pytest.ini updated with strict mock environment variables
3. ShadowTrafficMonitor mocking implemented
4. All external service calls mocked (Google Cloud, Qdrant, OpenAI, requests)
5. Subprocess calls mocked to prevent heavy operations

Issues Remaining:
- 370 skipped tests (need to reduce to ~6 intentional skips)
- 14 failed tests (need investigation and fixes)

Next Steps for CLI140m.64:
- Analyze and fix the 14 failed tests
- Reduce skipped tests by removing unnecessary @pytest.mark.deferred decorators
- Achieve target of ~6 intentional skips only
