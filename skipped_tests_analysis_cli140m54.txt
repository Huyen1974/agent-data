CLI140m.54 - Analysis of 72 Skipped Tests from CLI140m.52b
==============================================================

Date: June 19, 2025, 12:00 +07
Total Skipped Entries: 72 (from 1,698 test entries, 519 unique tests)
Unique Skipped Test Classes: 14

ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
================

UNINTENTIONAL SKIPS (Need Optimization): 4 tests
- test_rate_limit_boundary_conditions: Times out due to long sleep intervals (5s), needs optimization

OPTIMIZATION TARGETS:
====================

Priority 1 (High Impact): 
- test_rate_limit_boundary_conditions: Reduce sleep intervals from [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0] to [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5]

Priority 2 (Medium Impact):
- test_rapid_token_expiration: Remove @pytest.mark.slow or optimize token expiration timing
- test_subprocess_small_scale: Remove @pytest.mark.slow or optimize subprocess execution

Priority 3 (Low Impact):
- test_subprocess_real_api_calls: Mock API calls or increase timeout handling

MACBOOK M1 SAFETY NOTES:
========================
- All sleep intervals should be ≤ 0.5s for 8GB RAM compatibility
- Subprocess tests should have timeouts ≤ 8s
- Real API calls should be mocked in test environment
- Heavy computation tests should remain deferred

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Optimize the 4 unintentional skips identified above
2. Re-run tests to verify fixes
3. Update test markers appropriately
4. Commit changes with detailed descriptions
