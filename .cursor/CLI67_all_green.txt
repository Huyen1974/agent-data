New test: tests/api/test_invalid_threshold.py
Purpose: Verify API validation for score_threshold.
Payload: {"query_text":"test","top_k":3,"score_threshold":1.5}
Expected: HTTP 422, detail contains "score_threshold must be between 0 and 1".
Code fix: Added @field_validator to SemanticSearchRequest in api_vector_search.py.
Result: 16 tests passed.
All previous tests remain green.
