Purpose: Added test to verify .env.sample configuration, reaching 50 tests.
Total tests passing: 50/50 (48 passed, 2 skipped).
Summary: Ensured .env.sample is loadable and contains required keys (QDRANT_URL, QDRANT_API_KEY), finalizing v1.0 test suite at 50 tests.
Note: Next steps include CLI 103A for @slow test pipeline and mock drift check, followed by G2-G4 roadmap (CLI 103B-107B).
