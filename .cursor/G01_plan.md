# G01 GitHub Repository Setup Plan

**Date:** June 22, 2025, 17:00 +07  
**Repository:** `Huyen1974/agent-data`  
**Objective:** Create dedicated GitHub repository for Agent Data project with CI/CD setup

## Execution Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Steps

1. **Repository Creation**
   - Created GitHub repository `Huyen1974/agent-data` as public repository
   - Repository URL: https://github.com/Huyen1974/agent-data
   - Added comprehensive description about Agent Data project

2. **Local Repository Setup**
   - Navigated to `/Users/nmhuyen/Documents/Manual Deploy/mpc_back_end_for_agents/ADK/agent_data`
   - Found existing git repository on branch `stabilize/lock`
   - Added remote origin: `https://github.com/Huyen1974/agent-data.git`

3. **Documentation Creation**
   - Created comprehensive README.md with project overview, architecture, and setup instructions
   - Created .env.sample with frozen environment variables for configuration
   - Created this plan document (.cursor/G01_plan.md)

### üîÑ Next Steps (To be completed)

4. **CI Permissions Setup**
   - Update Workload Identity Provider to include `repo:Huyen1974/agent-data`
   - Add GitHub secrets for CI/CD authentication
   - Set up service account permissions

5. **Initial Commit and Push**
   - Stage and commit README.md and .env.sample
   - Push to main branch
   - Tag with `v0.1-green-repo-init`

6. **CI Verification**
   - Create minimal GitHub Actions workflow for authentication testing
   - Verify Workload Identity Federation works correctly

## Technical Details

### Repository Structure
- **Location:** `/Users/nmhuyen/Documents/Manual Deploy/mpc_back_end_for_agents/ADK/agent_data`
- **Remote:** `https://github.com/Huyen1974/agent-data.git`
- **Current Branch:** `stabilize/lock`
- **Target Branch:** `main`

### Environment Configuration
- Created .env.sample with key variables:
  - Runtime: `RUN_DEFERRED=0`, `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`
  - Testing: `PYTEST_TIMEOUT=8`, `BATCH_SIZE=3`
  - GCP: Project IDs, service accounts, Workload Identity
  - Qdrant: URL, API key, mock configuration
  - OpenAI: API key configuration

### Infrastructure References
- **Production Project:** `github-chatgpt-ggcloud`
- **Test Project:** `chatgpt-db-project`
- **Workload Identity Pools:** `github-pool`, `github-test-pool`
- **Service Accounts:** `chatgpt-deployer`, `gemini-service-account`

## Risk Assessment

### ‚úÖ Mitigated Risks
- GitHub CLI authentication verified
- Repository creation successful
- Local directory structure confirmed
- MacBook M1 memory constraints considered

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Risks
- Workload Identity Provider configuration needs update
- GitHub secrets need to be configured
- CI workflow testing required
- Branch strategy needs clarification (stabilize/lock vs main)

## Verification Criteria

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Repository exists: `gh repo view Huyen1974/agent-data`
- ‚úÖ README.md created with comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ .env.sample created with frozen variables
- ‚úÖ Local git repository configured with remote origin

### Pending
- ‚è≥ Workload Identity Provider updated
- ‚è≥ GitHub secrets configured
- ‚è≥ Initial commit pushed to main branch
- ‚è≥ Tag `v0.1-green-repo-init` created
- ‚è≥ Sample CI workflow runs successfully

## Commands Executed

```bash
# Repository creation
gh repo create Huyen1974/agent-data --public --description "..." --clone=false

# Local setup
cd ADK/agent_data
git remote add origin https://github.com/Huyen1974/agent-data.git

# Documentation
# Created README.md, .env.sample, .cursor/G01_plan.md
```

## Next Prompt Requirements

The next prompt (G02) should focus on:
1. Completing CI permissions setup
2. Pushing initial commit to main branch
3. Creating and testing sample GitHub Actions workflow
4. Verifying Workload Identity Federation
5. Tagging successful milestone

## Notes

- GitHub CLI is properly authenticated as `Huyen1974`
- Repository creation was successful despite `gh repo view` command issues
- Local repository already exists with substantial codebase
- MacBook M1 safety maintained throughout process
- No hanging commands encountered (all completed within timeout)
