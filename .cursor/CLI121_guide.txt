CLI121: Qdrant Latency Monitoring and Batch Processing Implementation Guide

OBJECTIVE:
Deploy monitoring and batch processing improvements to reduce Qdrant rate-limit risks for the Agent Data system running on the free tier.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:

1. Latency Probe Cloud Function
   Location: src/agent_data_manager/utils/latency_probe_function.py
   Features:
   - Asynchronous Qdrant client for ping and search latency measurement
   - P95 latency calculation and logging
   - Cloud Function entry point for serverless deployment
   - Automatic error handling and graceful degradation
   - Logging to logs/latency.log in standardized format

   Key Functions:
   - measure_ping_latency(): Tests basic Qdrant connectivity
   - measure_search_latency(): Tests search operation performance
   - run_full_probe(): Executes complete latency assessment
   - log_result_to_file(): Writes results in [timestamp] [operation] [latency] [status] format

2. Enhanced Settings Configuration
   Location: src/agent_data_manager/config/settings.py
   Added Environment Variables:
   - QDRANT_BATCH_SIZE: Default 100 (configurable batch size)
   - QDRANT_SLEEP: Default 0.35s (sleep between batches)

   Updated get_qdrant_config() to include:
   - batch_size: For batch processing control
   - sleep_between_batches: For rate-limit prevention

3. Batch Processing Policy Implementation
   Location: src/agent_data_manager/tools/qdrant_vectorization_tool.py
   Enhancements to batch_vectorize_documents():
   - Configurable batch size (default 100 documents per batch)
   - Sleep intervals between batches (default 0.35s)
   - Per-document rate limiting within batches
   - Enhanced logging with batch progress tracking
   - Detailed result reporting including batch metrics

   Flow:
   1. Split documents into configurable batches
   2. Process each document with rate limiting
   3. Sleep between batches (except after last batch)
   4. Return comprehensive metrics

4. P95 Latency Alert Policy
   Location: alert_policy_qdrant_latency.json
   Configuration:
   - P95 latency threshold: >1000ms (1 second)
   - Alert duration: 5 minutes
   - Auto-close: 1 hour
   - Notification rate limit: 15 minutes
   - Additional connection failure monitoring

5. Cloud Function Deployment Script
   Location: scripts/deploy_latency_probe.sh
   Features:
   - Automated deployment to asia-southeast1 region
   - Service account configuration (gemini-service-account)
   - Environment variables setup
   - Cloud Scheduler integration for hourly execution
   - Automatic testing and verification

6. Comprehensive Test Suite
   Location: tests/api/test_batch_policy.py
   Test Cases:
   - Batch size enforcement validation
   - Sleep interval timing verification
   - Rate limiting per document confirmation
   - Error handling with partial failures
   - Empty document list handling
   - Default configuration validation

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:

Batch Processing Policy:
- Default batch size: 100 documents
- Sleep between batches: 0.35 seconds
- Rate limiting: 300ms minimum interval per API call
- Processing: Sequential within batches, parallel batches with delays

Latency Monitoring:
- Ping measurement: Qdrant collections API call
- Search measurement: Dummy vector search operation
- P95 calculation: Maximum of ping/search latencies (2-sample approximation)
- Logging format: [ISO_timestamp] [operation] [latency_ms] [status]

Alert Configuration:
- Trigger: P95 latency > 1000ms sustained for 5 minutes
- Notification: Cloud Monitoring with rate limiting
- Auto-resolution: 1 hour timeout
- Additional: Connection failure monitoring

DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Deploy Latency Probe:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/deploy_latency_probe.sh
   ./scripts/deploy_latency_probe.sh
   ```

2. Set up Cloud Monitoring Alert:
   ```bash
   gcloud alpha monitoring policies create --policy-from-file=alert_policy_qdrant_latency.json
   ```

3. Configure Notification Channels (manual):
   - Email notifications via Cloud Console
   - Pub/Sub topic for automated responses

4. Test Batch Processing:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/api/test_batch_policy.py -v
   ```

VERIFICATION STEPS:

1. Latency Probe Function:
   - Check Cloud Function deployment status
   - Verify Cloud Scheduler hourly trigger
   - Monitor logs/latency.log for entries
   - Test manual function execution

2. Batch Processing:
   - Run test suite: pytest tests/api/test_batch_policy.py
   - Verify batch size configuration
   - Confirm sleep intervals are applied
   - Test with 8 documents for rate-limit safety

3. Alert Policy:
   - Verify alert policy creation in Cloud Monitoring
   - Test notification channels
   - Monitor for false positives

OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS:

Rate Limit Safety:
- Free tier: Qdrant Cloud us-east4-0 (1GB storage)
- Expected latency: 210-305ms per operation
- Batch size: 100 documents (safely under rate limits)
- Sleep interval: 0.35s (conservative buffer)

Performance Expectations:
- Ping latency: ~210ms (geographic baseline)
- Search latency: ~230ms (with vector operations)
- P95 threshold: 1000ms (rate-limit warning level)
- Batch throughput: ~171 docs/minute (with sleeps)

Monitoring Coverage:
- Hourly latency probes via Cloud Scheduler
- Real-time rate-limit detection
- Automated alerting for performance degradation
- Historical latency trending in logs

RISK MITIGATION:

1. Rate-Limit Prevention:
   - Conservative batch sizes (100 vs potential 1000+)
