Fix summary for CLI65:\n- Removed global TestClient in tests/api/test_embeddings_api.py.\n- Ensured all tests and relevant fixtures use the 'client' fixture from conftest.py.\n- Replaced unittest.mock.patch with FastAPI dependency overrides for mocking _generate_openai_embedding in test_embeddings_api.py.\n- This resolved an issue where mock embeddings were not consistently applied during test setup, leading to test_semantic_search_cosine failure.\n- Cleaned all debug print statements from tests/conftest.py (FakeQdrantClient).\n- All tests (14) are now passing.
