# CLI 126A Guide: Test Strategy Optimization

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

### CLI 126 Report Verification
- ✅ CLI 126 completed successfully with 98.84% pass rate (256/259 tests, 3 skipped)
- ✅ No failed tests, no need to run full suite during CLI 126A
- ✅ E2E tests: 4 tests implemented, running in ~2 seconds

### Test Optimization Tools Installed
- ✅ pytest-testmon 2.1.3: Runs only affected tests based on code changes
- ✅ pytest-xdist 3.7.0: Parallel test execution with worksteal distribution
- ✅ execnet 2.1.1: Required dependency for pytest-xdist

### Test Suite Analysis (259 Total Tests)

#### By Category:
- Core tests: 33 (essential functionality)
- E2E tests: 26 (including 4 new from CLI 126)
- Slow tests: 24 (>10 seconds execution)
- Deferred tests: 22 (can be skipped during development)

#### Test Optimization Strategy:
1. **Fast Selective**: pytest -q -m 'not slow and not deferred' --testmon
   - Excludes 46 tests (24 slow + 22 deferred)
   - Runs ~213 tests for development
   - Uses testmon for affected tests only

2. **Quick E2E**: pytest -m "e2e" -v
   - Runs 26 E2E tests in ~2 seconds
   - Perfect for quick validation

3. **Full Parallel**: pytest -n 8 --dist worksteal
   - Runs all 259 tests with 8 workers
   - Use before commits only

### Documentation Updated
- ✅ docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md: Added optimized test commands section
- ✅ Testing Guidelines: Added CLI 126A optimization strategy
- ✅ Test aliases documented: ptfast, ptfull

### Performance Results
- E2E tests (4 from CLI 126): 1.77 seconds
- E2E tests (all 26): ~2 seconds
- Parallel execution: 4.84 seconds for 4 tests with 4 workers
- Sequential execution: 1.45 seconds for 4 tests

### Ready for CLI 126C Test Reduction
- Current: 259 tests (256 passed, 3 skipped)
- Target: ~100-120 core tests active
- Strategy: Keep core (33) + e2e (26) + critical integration tests
- Defer: Non-critical tests marked with @pytest.mark.deferred

### Commands for Cursor Reference
```bash
# Quick development validation (2 seconds)
pytest -m "e2e" -v

# Fast selective tests (development)
pytest -q -m 'not slow and not deferred' --testmon

# Full suite with parallel execution (before commit)
pytest -n 8 --dist worksteal

# Count tests by category
pytest --collect-only -m "core" -q | wc -l    # 33 core
pytest --collect-only -m "e2e" -q | wc -l     # 26 e2e
pytest --collect-only -m "slow" -q | wc -l    # 24 slow
pytest --collect-only -m "deferred" -q | wc -l # 22 deferred
```

### Notes for Future CLIs
- CLI 126A successfully optimized test strategy without running full suite
- Test tools working correctly, ready for development acceleration
- Consider adding "smoke" marker for ~20 most critical tests
- Maintain 1 new test per CLI requirement (currently at 259)
- Use selective execution during development, full suite before commits

### Success Criteria Met
- ✅ CLI 126 report checked and confirmed
- ✅ Selective test execution configured
- ✅ Test optimization tools installed and tested
- ✅ Test commands standardized in documentation
- ✅ Test suite structure analyzed for CLI 126C reduction

Ready for git tag: cli126a_all_green
