CLI 88A 38-test issue investigation:

- Checked out tag `cli88a_all_green`.
- Verified `tests/test__meta_count.py` had `EXPECTED_TOTAL_TESTS = 38`.
- Ran `pytest --collect-only -q` which reported `38 tests collected`.

Conclusion: The 38 tests reported at CLI 88A were the correct number of tests at that time, not an unexpected count. The `test__meta_count.py` was correctly reflecting this. No actual issue or misconfiguration was found related to this specific count at CLI 88A.
