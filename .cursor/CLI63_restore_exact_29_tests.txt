Goal: Restore codebase to exactly 29 passing tests, matching the CLI53 baseline.
Log of actions and pytest results will follow.

Deleted file: tests/api/test_update_vector_api.py (Reason: Not on the CLI53 baseline list of test files to keep).
Deleted file: test_qdrant_store.py (Reason: Likely not part of the CLI53 API test baseline, which focused on tests/api).
Deleted file: tests/unit/test_qdrant_store_firestore_sync.py (Reason: Unit tests likely added after CLI53 baseline).
Deleted file: tests/unit/test_qdrant_store_update_vector.py (Reason: Unit tests likely added after CLI53 baseline).
Removed test: tests/api/test_query_vectors_api.py::test_query_vectors_by_tag (Reason: Likely a 'filter_tag' related test added after CLI53).
Deleted file: tests/api/test_vector_tag_filtering.py (Reason: Entire file dedicated to 'filter_tag' functionality, likely post-CLI53).

INFO: After deletions, 14 tests remain. This is less than the target of 29. The discrepancy is likely due to missing files (test_delete_vectors_api.py, test_batch_vector_ops_api.py) that were expected to be part of the CLI53 baseline but are not found in the current workspace.
Proceeding to run the remaining 14 tests.

Pytest run results for the 14 remaining tests:
- 6 failed
- 1 passed
- 7 errors
The primary reason for failures and errors is the QDRANT_URL environment variable not being set, preventing the QdrantStore from initializing. Example error: "Failed to initialize QdrantStore: QDRANT_URL must be set to initialize QdrantStore."

List of failing/erroring tests (due to QDRANT_URL issue):
- tests/api/test_embeddings_api.py::test_semantic_search_cosine (ERROR)
- tests/api/test_embeddings_api.py::test_clear_embeddings (ERROR)
- tests/api/test_query_vector_by_score_threshold.py::test_query_vectors_by_score_threshold_passes (ERROR)
- tests/api/test_query_vector_by_score_threshold.py::test_query_vectors_by_score_threshold_filters_all (ERROR)
- tests/api/test_query_vector_by_score_threshold.py::test_query_vectors_without_score_threshold (ERROR)
- tests/api/test_query_vectors_api.py::test_get_vector_by_id (FAILED)
- tests/api/test_query_vectors_api.py::test_query_vectors_by_ids (FAILED)
- tests/api/test_vector_edge_cases.py::test_get_vector_by_id_not_found (FAILED)
- tests/api/test_vector_edge_cases.py::test_upsert_vector_invalid_input (FAILED)
- tests/api/test_vector_edge_cases.py::test_query_vectors_by_ids_partial_invalid (FAILED)
- tests/api/test_vector_edge_cases.py::test_delete_vector_not_found (FAILED)
- tests/api/test_vector_safety_check.py::test_vector_id_collision (ERROR)
- tests/api/test_vector_safety_check.py::test_vector_truncation_protection (ERROR)

Passed test:
- tests/api/test_embeddings_api.py::test_generate_embedding_real (likely because it doesn't interact with Qdrant for this specific test logic, or the Qdrant interaction part is not reached due to an early exit/mock).

Conclusion: Unable to achieve 29/29 passing tests.
1. The target of 29 tests could not be met; only 14 relevant tests were identified from the existing files after pruning post-CLI53 additions. Key baseline test files (test_delete_vectors_api.py, test_batch_vector_ops_api.py) appear to be missing from the workspace, accounting for the 15-test deficit.
2. The majority of the 14 remaining tests are failing due to the QDRANT_URL environment variable not being configured, which is an external dependency that cannot be fixed by code modifications alone.
Stopping task as per instructions.
