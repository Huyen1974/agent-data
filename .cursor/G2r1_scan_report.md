# Syntax quick-scan

compileall: OK (no syntax errors found)

async@deferred:        0 lines listed in async_deferred.txt

total test files: 141

Next-steps suggestion: 
- Compileall passed, syntax is clean
- No async@deferred patterns found
- CI failure may be due to runtime/configuration issues
- Check CI logs for import errors or dependency issues
- Verify pytest configuration and test discovery
