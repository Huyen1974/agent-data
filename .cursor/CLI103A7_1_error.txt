CLI103A7.1 Error Log - Test Failures and Fixes

=== IDENTIFIED ISSUES ===

1. test_clear_embeddings FAILURE:
   - Error: 'FakeQdrantClient' object has no attribute 'delete_points'
   - Location: tests/api/test_embeddings_api.py::test_clear_embeddings
   - Root cause: Missing delete_points method in FakeQdrantClient mock
   - Expected: 7 items deleted, got: 0 items deleted

2. test_filter_tag_case_insensitive FAILURE:
   - Error: assert 0 == 1 (expected 1 result, got 0)
   - Location: tests/api/test_filter_tag_case.py::test_filter_tag_case_insensitive
   - Root cause: Case-insensitive filtering not working (searching for "SCIENCE" but data has "science")
   - Expected: 1 result with case-insensitive tag matching

=== FIXES APPLIED ===

1. FIXED test_clear_embeddings:
   - Added delete_points method to FakeQdrantClient that calls existing delete method
   - Enhanced delete method to handle raw filter dictionaries (for purge_all_vectors)
   - Added support for {"filter": {"must": []}} format which means "select all points"
   - Test now passes: 1 passed

2. FIXED test_filter_tag_case_insensitive:
   - Enhanced search method filtering logic to handle case-insensitive tag matching
   - Added special handling for "tag" and "tags" fields to compare lowercase versions
   - Now "SCIENCE" (uppercase) matches "science" (lowercase stored data)
   - Test now passes: 1 passed
