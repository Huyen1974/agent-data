Purpose: Added test to verify test suite contains 48 tests (before this new test).
Total tests passing: 49/49.
Summary: Fixed conftest.py for --count-tests-to and ensured meta-count test (test_meta_count_48.py) correctly verifies 49 total tests (including itself). The main meta count test (test__meta_count.py) also correctly asserts 49 total tests.
