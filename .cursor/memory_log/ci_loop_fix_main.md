# CLI 153.3 - CI Loop Fix for Main Branch (agent-data)

## Overview
Automatically check CI logs, identify errors, and fix them with up to 5 retry attempts for the main branch of `Huyen1974/agent-data`.

## Target Workflows
- Deploy to Google Cloud Functions
- Deploy Containers to Cloud Run  
- Deploy Cloud Workflows

## Loop Progress

### Loop 1 - Initial Assessment
**Time**: $(date)
**Action**: Checking current CI status and recent failures

#### Current Status Check
- Repository: Huyen1974/agent-data
- Branch: main
- Previous fixes applied in CLI153.2: ✅ Comprehensive workflow updates

#### Recent CI Runs Analysis
Attempting to fetch latest CI runs to identify specific failures...

**Issues Identified**:
1. Shell command execution issues preventing direct GitHub API access
2. Need to implement alternative approach for CI status checking
3. Previous CLI153.2 fixes may need verification

#### Fix Attempt 1: Direct Workflow Triggering
Since we successfully triggered workflows in CLI153.2, let's verify their current status by triggering them again and monitoring results.

**Actions Taken**:
- Will trigger each workflow individually
- Monitor execution in real-time
- Capture any error messages
- Apply fixes based on observed failures

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Identify specific failure points
- Determine if secrets are properly configured
- Verify authentication is working
- Check deployment permissions

### Next Steps
1. Trigger workflows individually
2. Monitor execution logs
3. Identify specific error patterns
4. Apply targeted fixes
5. Retry until success or max attempts reached

**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Loop 1
**Next Action**: Trigger and monitor individual workflows
