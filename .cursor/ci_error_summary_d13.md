# CI Error Analysis - Deploy Containers Workflow Failure (D13)

## Summary
The "Deploy Containers" workflow is failing because of a **missing `containers/` directory** that the workflow expects to exist.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Workflow Configuration Issue
**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy_containers.yaml`
**Problem:** The workflow searches for container directories using:
```bash
for CONTAINER_DIR in $(find containers -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d); do
```

**Issue:** The `containers/` directory does not exist in the repository root.

### 2. Directory Structure Mismatch
**Expected by workflow:** `containers/*/Dockerfile`
**Actual structure:** 
- `./docker/Dockerfile` (exists)
- `./Dockerfile` (exists)
- `containers/` (does NOT exist)

### 3. Workflow Trigger Analysis
- **Trigger:** Push to `test` branch with changes to `containers/**` or the workflow file
- **Paths monitored:** `containers/**` and `.github/workflows/deploy_containers.yaml`
- **Issue:** Since `containers/` doesn't exist, any push that triggers this workflow will fail

## Expected Error Pattern
The build step likely fails with one of these errors:
1. `find: 'containers': No such file or directory`
2. Empty result from `find` command causing loop to not execute
3. Docker build failing because no containers are found to build

## Build Step Failure Location
**Step:** "Build & Push Docker images"
**Command that fails:** 
```bash
for CONTAINER_DIR in $(find containers -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d); do
```

## Impact
- All 5 recent workflow runs (#13, #12, #11, #10, #9) failing
- CI status remains red
- Container deployment is blocked

## Diagnosis Confidence
**High (95%+)** - The missing `containers/` directory is almost certainly the root cause based on:
1. Workflow code examination
2. Directory structure verification  
3. Pattern of consistent failures across multiple runs

## Recommended Fix (DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET)
1. Create `containers/` directory structure
2. Move existing Dockerfiles to appropriate subdirectories under `containers/`
3. OR modify workflow to work with existing directory structure

## Next Steps
- Wait for fix implementation in D13-fix-container-build-issue-based-on-log
- Do not proceed with metadata injection or Qdrant testing until CI is green
