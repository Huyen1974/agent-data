# G2AC CI Validation - Completion Log

**Date:** Wed Jun 25 09:33:55 +07 2025  
**Status:** ✅ CORE OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED - CI MONITORING IN PROGRESS  
**MacBook M1:** All commands kept ≤15s for system stability

## ✅ COMPLETED OBJECTIVES

### 1. Branch & PR Setup
- ✅ Working on `ci/106-final` branch
- ✅ Committed latest changes 
- ✅ Force-pushed to origin
- ✅ **PR #10 Created:** https://github.com/Huyen1974/agent-data/pull/10

### 2. Local Validation
- ✅ **106 tests collected locally** (verified with `python -m pytest --collect-only --quiet | grep -c "test_"`)
- ✅ Manifest file `tests/manifest_106.txt` exists with 106 entries
- ✅ Root `conftest.py` configured for filtering

### 3. CI Configuration
- ✅ **Workflow properly configured** (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`)
- ✅ Triggers on `ci/106-final` pushes and PRs to main
- ✅ **Validates exactly 106 tests** with built-in assertion
- ✅ **CI manually triggered** via `gh workflow run ci.yaml --ref ci/106-final`

### 4. MacBook M1 Safeguards
- ✅ All commands executed in ≤15s timeouts
- ✅ Working directory maintained: `/Users/nmhuyen/Documents/Manual Deploy/mpc_back_end_for_agents/ADK/agent_data`
- ✅ Git hygiene maintained

## 🔄 MONITORING STATUS

**Manual Monitoring Required:** Due to MacBook M1 gh CLI JSON parsing issues, automated monitoring faced formatting challenges. However:

- ✅ **CI Workflow Triggered:** `workflow_dispatch` event created at 09:33:55
- ⏳ **Expected Run Time:** ~15-20 minutes per run
- 🎯 **Target:** 2 consecutive green runs with exactly 106 tests

## 📋 NEXT STEPS (Manual)

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Monitor CI Progress:** Visit https://github.com/Huyen1974/agent-data/actions
2. **Check Run Status:** Look for "CI Test Suite" runs on ci/106-final branch
3. **Verify 106 Test Count:** CI will assert exactly 106 tests collected

### On First Green Run:
- Wait for second run (PR-triggered or manual)
- Verify both runs show "106 tests collected"
- Verify 0 failed, ≤6 skipped

### On Double Green Success:
```bash
git tag v0.2-green-106
git push origin v0.2-green-106  
gh pr merge 10 --squash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d ci/106-final
```

### If CI Fails:
```bash
# Download artifacts for diagnosis
gh run download <run-id> -D .cursor/artifacts/

# Check test differences
python -m pytest --collect-only --quiet > collected_ci.txt
comm -3 <(sort tests/manifest_106.txt) <(sort collected_ci.txt) > manifest_diff.txt

# Create fix branch
git checkout -b ci/106-fix-1
```

## 🛡️ GUARD-RAILS MAINTAINED

- ✅ All individual commands ≤15s execution time
- ✅ MacBook M1 system stability preserved
- ✅ Working directory consistency maintained
- ✅ Git branch hygiene followed
