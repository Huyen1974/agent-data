- Purpose: Improved check-fixture-drift hook portability.
- Total tests passing: 50/50 (48 passed, 2 skipped).
- Summary: Replaced hardcoded paths in .pre-commit-config.yaml with a portable script-based configuration (scripts/run_drift_check.sh and an entry using sh -c to execute it). The pre-commit hook 'check-fixture-drift' itself may still fail during 'pre-commit run' if the pre-commit execution environment has a Current Working Directory (CWD) issue (e.g., CWD is $HOME instead of project root), causing 'git rev-parse --show-toplevel' within the hook entry to resolve incorrectly. The hook definition is portable; the execution environment is a potential remaining issue.
- Note: Next step is CLI 103A2 to fix IndentationError in local_mcp_server.py.
