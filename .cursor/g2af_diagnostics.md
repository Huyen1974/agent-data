# G2AF Diagnostics Report
**Date:** $(date)  
**Branch:** ci/106-final-pass  
**Issue:** CI workflow not triggering

## Problem Summary
✅ **Local Configuration:** All correct
- pytest collects exactly 106 tests
- conftest.py has proper --qdrant-mock option handler
- pytest.ini is clean
- manifest_106.txt contains 106 test entries

❌ **CI Trigger Issue:** No workflow runs detected
- Branch pushed successfully to origin
- Empty commit attempted
- API shows no runs for ci/106-final-pass branch
- Recent runs show "CI Pipeline" vs expected "CI Test Suite"

## Diagnostic Findings

### 1. Workflow File Discrepancy
- Local `read_file` shows: "CI Test Suite" with branches including ci/106-final-pass
- Terminal `head` shows: "CI Pipeline" with branches [init, main, fix/ci-pass]
- This suggests version control sync issues

### 2. Repository Access
- Repository: Huyen1974/agent-data ✅
- Branch exists on remote ✅  
- Workflow files exist (.github/workflows/ci.yaml) ✅
- API authentication failing (401/404 errors) ❌

### 3. Alternative Workflows
Available workflows via API:
- Authentication Test (.github/workflows/auth-test.yaml)
- Basic Test (.github/workflows/basic-test.yaml)  
- CI Pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yaml) - ACTIVE

## Recommended Actions
1. **Verify workflow file sync:** Check if local and remote ci.yaml differ
2. **Try alternative trigger:** Create PR to trigger pull_request workflow
3. **Check repository settings:** Verify GitHub Actions are enabled
4. **Manual verification:** Check GitHub web interface for workflow status

## Verification Criteria Still Met
✅ Local test collection: 106 tests  
✅ Zero --qdrant-mock flags in CI workflow  
✅ Root configuration files correct  
❌ CI green validation pending
