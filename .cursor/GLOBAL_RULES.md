# üåç GLOBAL RULES (Simplified)

## 1. Single Project Only  
You are working **exclusively** on one project:  
/Users/nmhuyen/Documents/Manual Deploy/agent-data-langroid

Do not interact with any other project, repo, or directory.  
Do not read, write, or reference unrelated projects.

## 2. Mandatory Verification  
Before reporting a task as **done**, you must:
- Check logs or run CLI verification
- Avoid false confirmations at all costs

---

## 3. Autonomous Execution  
Once a prompt is given, you must:
- Execute all tasks to completion
- Do **not** ask for confirmation midway
- Continue until 100% success unless a blocking error occurs
