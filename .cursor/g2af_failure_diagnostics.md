# G2AF Failure Diagnostics
**Date:** $(date)  
**Run ID:** 15866840448  
**Branch:** ci/106-fix-3  
**Status:** failure

## Failure Summary
❌ **CI Run Failed:** "Run minimal tests" step failed  
❌ **Cannot download logs:** 403 permission error  
❌ **Workflow file inconsistency:** Local vs remote mismatch

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Workflow File Discrepancy
- **Terminal shows:** "CI Pipeline" with basic job structure
- **read_file shows:** "CI Test Suite" with 106-test validation
- **Problem:** Git/filesystem inconsistency causing wrong workflow to execute

### 2. Failed Step Analysis
From API job details:
- ✅ Setup steps (checkout, auth, python, deps) all passed
- ✅ Debug test collection passed
- ❌ **"Run minimal tests" FAILED** ← Primary failure point
- ⏭️ Core tests skipped (due to minimal test failure)

### 3. Local vs Remote State
- **Local collection:** `pytest --collect-only -q` = 106 tests ✅
- **Remote execution:** Likely using wrong workflow definition
- **Branch trigger:** ci/106-fix-3 added correctly to push triggers

## Probable Root Causes
1. **Workflow file sync issue:** Local edits not properly reflected on remote
2. **Test configuration mismatch:** CI using different conftest.py/pytest.ini than expected
3. **Dependency issue:** Missing packages or wrong Python environment
4. **Authentication/permission:** GCP auth or file access problems

## Comparison with manifest_106.txt
Expected: 106 tests from tests/manifest_106.txt  
**Cannot verify actual collection due to log access restrictions**

## Recommended Fix Actions
1. Force-sync workflow file to match expected "CI Test Suite" format
2. Verify conftest.py and pytest.ini are correctly pushed to remote
3. Add more explicit test collection validation in workflow
4. Consider using simpler workflow structure that matches what's actually running

## Next Steps (ci/106-fix-4)
- [ ] Replace workflow file with verified working version
- [ ] Add explicit test count validation before running tests
- [ ] Ensure all config files are properly synchronized
- [ ] Test locally before pushing
