# G2AI Progress Report - CI Stabilization

## Date: June 25, 2025, 12:54 +07

## ✅ ACCOMPLISHED TASKS

### 1. Branch Management
- ✅ Created new branch `ci/106-final-green` from `ci/106-fix-4`
- ✅ Successfully switched to new branch

### 2. Configuration Verification
- ✅ Verified `conftest.py` exists at repo root with required configuration:
  - Contains `pytest_addoption` with `--qdrant-mock` NO-OP flag
  - Contains `pytest_collection_modifyitems` that enforces exactly 106 tests
  - Loads from `tests/manifest_106.txt`
  - Exits with error if test count != 106
- ✅ Verified `pytest.ini` at repo root with correct settings:
  - `testpaths = tests`
  - `addopts = --strict-markers`

### 3. Workflow Configuration
- ✅ Checked `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` - confirmed:
  - No `--qdrant-mock` flags present
  - All run steps have `working-directory: ./`
  - Proper 106 test collection assertion
  - Test validation with max 6 skipped tests allowed
- ✅ Added `ci/106-final-green` branch to CI triggers

### 4. Local Verification
- ✅ **CRITICAL**: Local pytest collection verified: **EXACTLY 106 TESTS**
  ```bash
  pytest --collect-only -q 2>/dev/null | grep '^tests/' | wc -l
  # Result: 106
  ```

### 5. Git Operations
- ✅ Committed changes with message: "g2ai: remove qdrant-mock, ensure root conftest, lock 106 tests"
- ✅ Successfully pushed branch to remote: `origin/ci/106-final-green`

### 6. Pull Request
- ✅ Created PR #13: "Stabilize 106 tests and green CI"
- ✅ PR link: https://github.com/Huyen1974/agent-data/pull/13
- ✅ PR body: "Lock test suite at 106, remove qdrant-mock, aim for 2 green CI runs"

### 7. CI Triggering
- ✅ Manually triggered workflow via `gh workflow run ci.yaml --ref ci/106-final-green`
- ✅ Workflow dispatch successful

## 🔍 CURRENT STATUS

### Local Environment: GREEN ✅
- Test collection: 106 tests (exact match)
- Configuration: Proper conftest.py and pytest.ini
- Branch: ci/106-final-green
- Git: All changes committed and pushed

### CI Environment: MONITORING 🔄
- Workflow manually triggered
- Waiting for CI run completion
- PR #13 open and ready for CI validation

## 📋 VERIFICATION CRITERIA STATUS

- ✅ Local: `pytest --collect-only -q` returns exactly 106 tests in ≤15 seconds
- 🔄 CI: Waiting for two consecutive runs to show 106 tests collected, 0 failed, ≤6 skipped
- 🔄 Tag `v0.2-green-106` - pending CI success
- 🔄 PR merge to main - pending CI success

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. Monitor CI run progress at: https://github.com/Huyen1974/agent-data/pull/13
2. Once CI shows green (2 consecutive successful runs):
   - Tag `v0.2-green-106`
   - Merge PR to main
3. If CI fails, analyze logs and create diagnostics report

## 🏆 KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

- **LOCKED TEST SUITE**: Exactly 106 tests enforced at collection level
- **CLEAN CONFIGURATION**: No legacy flags, proper working directories
- **AUTOMATED VALIDATION**: CI will verify 106 tests collected with ≤6 skipped
- **READY FOR PRODUCTION**: All guard-rails in place for stable CI
