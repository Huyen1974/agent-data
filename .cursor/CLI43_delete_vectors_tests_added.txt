Integration tests for DELETE endpoints /delete_vector, /delete_vectors_by_tag, and /purge_all_vectors added in tests/api/test_delete_vectors_api.py.

Key features of the tests:
- Use FastAPI's TestClient with the real application (no mocking).
- Set up test data using POST /upsert_vector before each deletion.
- Assert correct status codes and response payloads.
- Verify actual data removal from Qdrant after deletions.

Troubleshooting steps taken:
1. Initial test runs failed due to unawaited async calls in `api_vector_search.py` for QdrantStore methods (`upsert_vector`, `delete_vector`, `delete_vectors_by_tag`, `purge_all_vectors`). Added `await` where necessary in `api_vector_search.py`.
2. Subsequent failures for `test_delete_vectors_by_tag` and `test_purge_all_vectors` showed a `TypeError: Cannot instantiate typing.Union` when `PointsSelector` was explicitly instantiated within `QdrantStore` methods.
3. Modified `QdrantStore` to pass raw `Filter` objects and lists of point IDs directly to `self.client.delete()` for the `points_selector` argument, bypassing explicit `PointsSelector` instantiation. This resolved the `TypeError`.

All tests now pass, confirming the deletion endpoints function correctly in an integrated environment.
