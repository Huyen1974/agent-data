New test: tests/api/test_invalid_top_k.py
Purpose: Verify API validation for negative top_k.
Payload: {"query_text":"quick check","top_k":-5,"score_threshold":0.3}
Expected: HTTP 422, detail msg "Input should be greater than or equal to 1".
Code fix: None needed. Existing Pydantic validation for top_k (ge=1) was sufficient.
Test fix: Adjusted assertion to match Pydantic's exact error message.
Result: 17 tests passed.
All previous tests remain green.
