## Diagnostic Analysis

### Issue Description
The workflow failed because it uses `actions/upload-artifact@v3`, which GitHub deprecated and now automatically fails.

### Required Fix
Update the workflow YAML file to use `actions/upload-artifact@v4` instead of `actions/upload-artifact@v3`.

### Impact
- No tests were executed
- The failure occurred during job setup phase
- This affects all CI runs on the `ci/final-519` branch

### Next Steps
1. Update the workflow file(s) to use `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
2. Update any other deprecated actions if present
3. Re-run the CI pipeline
