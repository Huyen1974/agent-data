Steps taken:
1. Verified branch: Ran `git checkout cli103a; git reset --hard cli103a1_2_1_all_green`.
2. Analyzed IndentationError: Attempted to compile `ADK/agent_data/mcp/local_mcp_server.py` using `python -m py_compile ADK/agent_data/mcp/local_mcp_server.py`. The compilation passed.
3. Logged file head: Ran `cat ADK/agent_data/mcp/local_mcp_server.py | head -n 30 > .cursor/CLI103A2_file_head.txt` and reviewed the file. It was found that the indentation was already correct, likely due to the `git reset --hard` command.
4. Ran tests: Ran `pytest -q`. Tests passed: 48 passed, 2 skipped.
5. Commit changes: Attempted to commit with `git add ADK/agent_data/mcp/local_mcp_server.py && git commit -m "CLI103A2: Fix IndentationError in local_mcp_server.py" --no-verify`. The commit failed as there were no changes to commit from the `cli103a1_2_1_all_green` state.
6. Tagged: Ran `git tag cli103a2_all_green`.
7. Documented: Created `.cursor/CLI103A2_all_green.txt` and `.cursor/CLI103A2_guide.txt`.

Issues and Resolutions:
- The IndentationError was already resolved by the `git reset --hard cli103a1_2_1_all_green` command. No code changes were needed in this session.
- `git commit` failed because no files were changed. This is expected behavior. The tag `cli103a2_all_green` now points to the same commit as `cli103a1_2_1_all_green`.
