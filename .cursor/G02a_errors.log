**Status**: FAILED
**Commit**: ce29290e3e426fc4e0a91784f83ae55cab13d4b9
**Error Type**: Deprecated GitHub Actions

### Error Details:
```
##[error]This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`. 
Learn more: https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/
```

### Root Cause:
The CI workflow was using deprecated versions of GitHub Actions:
- actions/cache@v3 (should be v4)
- codecov/codecov-action@v3 (should be v4) 
- actions/upload-artifact@v3 (should be v4)

### Fix Applied:
Updated all deprecated actions to their latest versions:
- actions/cache@v3 → actions/cache@v4
- codecov/codecov-action@v3 → codecov/codecov-action@v4
- actions/upload-artifact@v3 → actions/upload-artifact@v4

### Next Action:
Commit the fixes and trigger a new CI run.
