CLI 119D5: Test Agent Functionalities with Qdrant API Real Calls and Prepare for Cursor Connectivity
==================================================================================================

EXECUTION PLAN:
1. Test Suite Stability - Re-run test suite on chatgpt-db-project to maximize passing tests
2. Qdrant API Key - Refresh qdrant-api-key-sg in Secret Manager
3. Agent Functionalities - Test upsert, query, semantic search with Qdrant API real calls
4. Metrics - Generate metrics with real API calls, verify in Pushgateway and Cloud Monitoring
5. Alerting - Deploy alert_policy_latency.json if metrics are available
6. New Test Case - Add test to validate real API calls with >75% success rate
7. Documentation - Update KH2_Grok Qdrant.txt with CLI 119A1-D4.2 summary
