# G2AF CI Final Pass - Plan Tracking

## Status: In Progress

### Completed Steps
✅ Created branch `ci/106-final-pass` from `ci/106-fix-flag2`  
✅ Local safety check: pytest collects exactly 106 tests  
✅ All files have correct configuration:
   - conftest.py has proper pytest_addoption for --qdrant-mock
   - pytest.ini is clean (no flags)
   - manifest_106.txt exists with 106 entries

### Current Issue
❌ CI workflow not triggering for `ci/106-final-pass` branch
- Branch pushed successfully to origin
- Empty commit attempted to trigger CI
- API shows no workflow runs for this branch
- Recent runs show "CI Pipeline" workflow (not "CI Test Suite")
- Workflow file discrepancy between local read and terminal commands

### Next Steps
1. Verify workflow file sync between local and remote
2. Manually trigger workflow or investigate trigger conditions
3. Monitor for CI runs with 20-second polling
4. On success: tag v0.2-green-106 and merge PR
