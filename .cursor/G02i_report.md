## Summary of CI Runs Analyzed

- **Runs Analyzed**: 1 run (15819623670)
- **Status**: ❌ FAILED
- **Total Tests**: 0 (test collection failed)
- **Passed**: 0
- **Failed**: 0  
- **Skipped**: 0
- **Deselected**: 0

## Failure Analysis

### Primary Issue
The CI run failed during the "Collect & Compare - Run 1" step with exit code 2. The workflow was unable to collect tests due to Python syntax errors.

### Root Cause Identified
Through detailed analysis, the core issue is **invalid Python syntax** in multiple test files:

```
File "/tests/test_cli140m7_coverage.py", line 101
E       async @pytest.mark.deferred
E             ^
E   SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

### Affected Files
The following test files contain syntax errors:
- `tests/test_cli140m1_coverage.py`
- `tests/test_cli140m2_additional_coverage.py` 
- `tests/test_cli140m4_coverage.py`
- `tests/test_cli140m7_coverage.py`
- `tests/test_cli140m11_coverage.py`
- `tests/test_cli140m12_coverage.py`
- `tests/test_cli140m13_coverage.py`
- `tests/legacy/test_cli140m8_coverage.py`

### Specific Pattern
All errors follow the pattern `async @pytest.mark.deferred` which should be:
```python
@pytest.mark.deferred
async def test_function():
```

### Test Collection Results
When attempting local collection: `519/547 tests collected (28 deselected), 8 errors`
- Target: 519 tests ✅ (achievable once syntax is fixed)
- Errors: 8 syntax errors ❌ (blocking CI)

## Current Status vs G02i Requirements

| Requirement | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-------------|----------|---------|---------|
| Total Tests | 519 | 0 (collection failed) | ❌ Failed |
| Failed Tests | 0 | N/A | ❌ Failed |
| Skipped Tests | ≤6 | N/A | ❌ Failed |
| Two Runs | 2 consecutive | 1 failed early | ❌ Failed |

## Parser Script Implementation

Created `scripts/parse_junit.py` as specified in G02i prompt:
- ✅ JUnit XML parser implemented
- ✅ Handles failures, skipped, and deselected counts
- ❌ No XML files to analyze (collection failed)

## Recommendation

**Immediate Action Required**: Fix syntax errors before re-running CI

### Step-by-Step Fix
1. **Fix Syntax Pattern**: Replace `async @pytest.mark.deferred` with proper decorator + async syntax
2. **Validate Collection**: Ensure `python -m pytest --collect-only -q -m "not deferred and not slow" --qdrant-mock` succeeds
3. **Re-trigger CI**: Push fixes and run workflow again
4. **Monitor Results**: Wait for 2 successful consecutive runs

### Expected Outcome After Fix
- 519 tests collected ✅
- 0 syntax errors ✅  
- Successful CI runs with full test execution

## Next Steps

❌ **Cannot proceed with merge/tagging** - CI runs failed to meet success criteria

**Required Actions:**
1. Fix Python syntax errors in 8 test files
2. Re-run CI workflow on fix/ci-final4 branch  
3. Verify 2 consecutive successful runs with:
   - 519 tests collected
   - 0 failed tests
   - ≤6 skipped tests
4. Only after success criteria met:
   - `gh pr merge --squash 1`
   - `gh release create v0.2-ci-full-pass -t "CI stable with 519 tests"`

## Files Created
- ✅ `scripts/parse_junit.py` - JUnit XML parser (ready for use)
- ✅ `.cursor/G02i_report.md` - This analysis report

## Architecture Notes
- CI workflow properly configured for `fix/ci-final4` branch ✅
- Test count target updated to 519 ✅
- Matrix strategy (2 runs) implemented ✅  
- Missing: syntax error fixes to enable test collection ❌
