# G02e CI Implementation Status

**Date**: $(date)
**Branch**: fix/ci-pass-final  
**Objective**: Resolve test issues, adjust test collection to exactly 485 tests, ensure consistently green CI suite with 2 consecutive runs

## ✅ COMPLETED OBJECTIVES:

### 1. Test Collection Optimization
- ✅ Updated pytest.ini to consistently collect 485 tests
- ✅ Modified `addopts` to exclude only deferred tests: `-m "not deferred"`
- ✅ Updated `tests/test__meta_count.py` to expect `EXPECTED_TOTAL_TESTS = 485`

### 2. Environment Variable Mocking  
- ✅ Added `pytest_configure()` function in `tests/conftest.py`
- ✅ Mocked `OPENAI_API_KEY = "mock_key"` and `GCP_KEY = "mock_key"`

### 3. CI Configuration Enhancement
- ✅ Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` to include `fix/ci-pass-final` branch
- ✅ Implemented matrix strategy for 2 consecutive runs (`run_number: [1, 2]`)
- ✅ Added comprehensive test count validation
- ✅ Enhanced test result parsing and reporting
- ✅ Added G02e validation summary job
- ✅ Implemented proper artifact generation with run-specific naming

### 4. Documentation & Tracking
- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation plan in `.cursor/G02e_plan.md`
- ✅ Documented all changes, known issues, and next steps

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA STATUS:
- ✅ 485 tests collected consistently  
- ⏳ 2 consecutive green CI runs (triggered, monitoring)
- ✅ Proper artifact generation configured
- ⏳ Tag v0.2-ci-full-pass creation (pending CI success)

## �� NEXT STEPS:
1. Monitor current CI run for 2 consecutive green results
2. If successful, tag as v0.2-ci-full-pass  
3. Close PR #1 and merge to main
4. Proceed to G03 for Terraform backend setup

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS: 
**G02e Implementation COMPLETE** - Awaiting CI validation results
