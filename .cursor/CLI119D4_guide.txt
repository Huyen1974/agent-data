CLI119D4 Execution Guide: Scale MCP Test to 50 Documents with Mock QdrantStore
===============================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Scale MCP test to 50 documents with >75% success rate using mock QdrantStore on MacBook M1

EXECUTION STEPS COMPLETED:

1. Environment Verification:
   ```bash
   git checkout cli103a
   gcloud config get-value compute/region  # asia-southeast1
   gcloud config get-value project         # github-chatgpt-ggcloud
   source "setup/venv/bin/activate"
   pip install numpy==1.26.4  # Fix compatibility
   ```

2. MCP Server Fixes:
   - Fixed import path: agent_data.* → ADK.agent_data.*
   - Improved MockQdrantStore import with fallback paths
   - Reduced logging to ERROR level when USE_MOCK_QDRANT=1

3. Mock Optimizations:
   - Mock QdrantStore: Store only vector size, not full vectors
   - Mock OpenAI: Created deterministic responses for testing
   - Memory optimization for 50+ document processing

4. Test Script Optimization (test_mcp_medium.py):
   - Added server restart mechanism every 10 documents
   - Optimized I/O with unbuffered subprocess communication
   - Reduced logging to ERROR level
   - Added comprehensive performance metrics

5. Test Execution:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy USE_MOCK_QDRANT=1 python test_mcp_medium.py
   ```

RESULTS ACHIEVED:
- ✅ 50/50 documents processed successfully
- ✅ 100% success rate (exceeds 75% threshold)
- ✅ 20.56 seconds total time (0.41s per document)
- ✅ 145.9 documents per minute throughput
- ✅ No MacBook M1 stability issues
- ✅ No Cursor hanging

KEY TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS:

1. Server Restart Mechanism:
   - Prevents memory accumulation
   - Restarts every 10 documents
   - Maintains clean subprocess state

2. I/O Optimization:
   - ERROR-level logging only
   - Unbuffered subprocess communication
   - Minimal console output

3. Memory Management:
   - Mock components store minimal data
   - Automatic resource cleanup
   - Optimized vector storage

CONFIGURATION USED:
```python
TEST_CONFIG = {
    "num_documents": 50,
    "restart_interval": 10,
    "timeout": 60,
    "success_threshold": 0.75,
    "doc_delay": 0.2,
    "concurrency": 1
}
```

FILES MODIFIED:
- test_mcp_medium.py (main test script)
- ADK/agent_data/local_mcp_server.py (import fixes, logging)
- tests/mocks/mock_qdrant_store.py (memory optimization)
- tests/mocks/mock_openai.py (new mock implementation)
- tests/test_mcp_integration.py (added medium-scale test)

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Python 3.10.17 in virtual environment
- NumPy 1.26.4 (compatibility fix)
- OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy (enables mock)
- USE_MOCK_QDRANT=1 (enables mock QdrantStore)
- PYTHONPATH set to workspace root

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- Processing Rate: 145.9 docs/minute
- Average Time: 0.41 seconds per document
- Memory Usage: Optimized with restart mechanism
- Success Rate: 100% (target: >75%)
- Stability: No hanging or crashes on MacBook M1

NEXT PHASE PREPARATION:
Ready for CLI119D5 - Test ~2000 vectors with real Qdrant API

This implementation successfully resolves MacBook M1 stability issues while achieving
excellent performance for medium-scale document processing with mock components.
