# Agent Data Langroid

A multi-agent architecture system built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Langroid framework for intelligent data processing and management.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project implements a sophisticated multi-agent system that leverages:
- **Langroid Framework**: For intelligent agent orchestration
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Cloud-native infrastructure
- **Vector Storage**: Advanced semantic search capabilities
- **Real-time Processing**: Scalable data ingestion and processing

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Distributed intelligent agents for specialized tasks
- **Cloud-Native Design**: Built for GCP with auto-scaling capabilities
- **Vector Search**: Advanced semantic search using embeddings
- **Real-time Processing**: Stream processing for live data ingestion
- **API Gateway**: RESTful APIs with authentication and rate limiting
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Comprehensive observability stack
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
