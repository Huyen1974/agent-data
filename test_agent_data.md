# Agent Data Test Summary

**Timestamp:** July 14, 2025, 10:00 AM GMT+7

## Overview
The refactoring of Dockerfile.test was completed with pinned Python version 3.10.14-slim-buster, locked dependencies via requirements.lock, buildx cache integration in CI, and optimized .dockerignore. Dependencies were locked using pip-compile, and changes were committed and pushed to trigger CI.

## Key Actions and Outputs

- **Backup:** Created git tag backup/cli1861 and bundle backup-cli1861.bundle.
- **GCP Verification:** Project is github-chatgpt-ggcloud; service account exists.
- **Dependency Locking:** requirements.lock generated successfully (contents include anthropic==0.45.2, pytest==8.4.1, etc.). Committed as chore(deps).
- **Dockerfile.test Refactor:** Updated to multi-stage with build-essential, timeout/retries, non-root user, healthcheck, and env vars.
- **.dockerignore:** Created with exclusions for .git, tests/, docs/, etc.
- **CI Update:** Added Docker Buildx setup and used build-push-action with GHA cache in .github/workflows/ci.yml.
- **Commit and Push:** Final commit feat(ci) pushed to main, triggering CI.

## Validation
- Local build failed due to Docker daemon not running. Recommendation: Start Docker Desktop and run `time docker buildx build -f Dockerfile.test -t agent-data-test:local . --no-cache --load` to validate locally.
- Image size and build time validation pending local build success.
- CI build time should be checked in GitHub Actions logs for under 1 minute on subsequent runs due to cache.
- pip list in container would match requirements.lock once built.

## Notes
All steps completed except local Docker validation due to environment issue. CI should confirm the optimizations.
