CLI38: QdrantStore.update_vector() method has been verified to meet CLI37 requirements.
Unit tests have been created in tests/unit/test_qdrant_store_update_vector.py, covering:
- Calls to self.upsert_vector with correct parameters.
- Behavior with Firestore sync enabled/disabled (via mocking of upsert_vector).
- Handling of exceptions from upsert_vector.
- Support for both integer and string point_ids.
All tests are passing.
