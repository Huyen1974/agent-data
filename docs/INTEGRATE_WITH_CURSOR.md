# Integrating Agent Data MCP with Cursor

This document describes how to run the Agent Data MCP (Minimal Compute Platform) agent locally and configure Cursor to communicate with it using standard input/output (stdio).

## 1. Running the MCP Agent

The MCP agent is designed to run as a standalone process, communicating via JSON messages over stdin and stdout. It avoids the overhead of a full web server like FastAPI/Uvicorn.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python environment set up (e.g., using the project's `venv`).
*   Necessary dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt` - ensure requirements include base agent needs).
*   (Optional but Recommended) `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set if you need tools that rely on OpenAI embeddings.

**Steps:**

1.  **Navigate to the agent directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project/ADK/agent_data
    ```

2.  **Activate your virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Example using venv
    source ../../setup/venv/bin/activate
    # Or conda activate your_env_name
    ```

3.  **Run the MCP server script:**
    There should be a script dedicated to running the agent in MCP mode. Assuming it's named `local_mcp_server.py` inside the `ADK/agent_data` directory:
    ```bash
    python local_mcp_server.py
    ```
    *   **Note:** If the script is located elsewhere (e.g., `mcp/local_server.py`), adjust the command accordingly.

    The agent will start, initialize its tools (logging output is expected), and wait for JSON input on stdin.

## 2. Configuring Cursor for MCP Connection

Cursor can interact with external tools/LSPs (Language Server Protocol) via stdio. We can leverage this to connect to our running MCP agent.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open Cursor Settings:** Go to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or `Code > Preferences > Settings` on macOS).
2.  **Search for "External Tools" or "LSP":** Look for settings related to configuring external language servers or tools. The exact naming might vary slightly between Cursor versions.
3.  **Add a New Tool/LSP Configuration:**
    *   Find an option to add a new configuration.
    *   You'll typically need to provide:
        *   **Language ID / Name:** Give it a relevant name, e.g., `agent-data-mcp`.
        *   **Command:** The command Cursor should execute to start the agent and establish the stdio connection. This should be the *same command* you used to run the agent manually in the terminal.
            *   **Crucially:** Use the *absolute path* to your Python executable within the virtual environment and the *absolute path* to the `local_mcp_server.py` script.
            *   Example (adjust paths based on your setup):
                ```
                /Users/nmhuyen/Documents/Manual Deploy/mpc_back_end_for_agents/setup/venv/bin/python "/Users/nmhuyen/Documents/Manual Deploy/mpc_back_end_for_agents/ADK/agent_data/local_mcp_server.py"
                ```
            *   Make sure the command runs the script directly, not via `python -m ...` unless the script is designed for that.
        *   **Arguments (Optional):** If the script requires specific command-line arguments, add them here.
        *   **Working Directory (Optional but Recommended):** Set this to the agent's directory (`ADK/agent_data`) to ensure correct relative path resolution for data files (like FAISS indices).
            *   Example:
                ```
                /Users/nmhuyen/Documents/Manual Deploy/mpc_back_end_for_agents/ADK/agent_data
                ```
        *   **Environment Variables (Optional):** If needed (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY` if not globally set), you might be able to define them here.

4.  **Save Settings:** Save the Cursor settings.
5.  **Restart Cursor (Recommended):** Restart Cursor to ensure the new tool configuration is loaded correctly.

## 3. JSON Communication Format

The communication follows a simple request/response pattern using newline-delimited JSON objects. The agent can process both single requests and batches of requests.

**Cursor Request (Sent to Agent stdin):**

*   **Single Request:** A standard JSON object.
    ```json
    {
      "id": "unique_request_id_string",
      "tool_name": "name_of_the_tool_to_execute",
      "args": { /* Dictionary of arguments */ },
      "kwargs": { /* Optional keyword arguments */ }
    }
    ```
*   **Batch Request:** A JSON list containing multiple single request objects.
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": "batch-req-1",
        "tool_name": "tool_A",
        "args": { "arg1": "valueA" }
      },
      {
        "id": "batch-req-2",
        "tool_name": "tool_B",
        "args": { "arg1": "valueB" },
        "kwargs": { "option": true }
      },
      {
        "tool_name": "tool_C",
        "args": {}
        // ID is optional, agent will generate one
      }
    ]
    ```

**Agent Response (Sent to Cursor stdout):**

Responses always follow a standardized format. For batch requests, the agent returns a JSON list where each element corresponds to a request in the input batch.

*   **Standard Response Object Format:**
    ```json
    {
      "id": "unique_request_id_string", // Matches request ID, or auto-generated if missing
      "status": "success" | "failed",   // Execution status of this specific request
      "result": { ... } | null,       // Contains the tool's return value (usually a dict) on success, null on failure (or maybe partial result).
      "error": null | "Error message string", // Null on success, error description on failure.
      "meta": {
          "processing_time_ms": 123.45 // Time taken for this request in milliseconds
          // ... other potential metadata ...
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Example Response (Single Success):**
    ```json
    {"id":"req-1","status":"success","result":{"status":"success","echoed_text":"Hello"},"error":null,"meta":{"processing_time_ms":10.5}}
    ```

*   **Example Response (Single Failure):**
    ```json
    {"id":"req-2","status":"failed","result":null,"error":"Tool 'bad_tool' not found.","meta":{"processing_time_ms":5.2}}
    ```
*   **Example Response (Batch with Mixed Results):**
    ```json
    [
      {"id":"batch-req-1","status":"success","result":{"status":"success","output":"Result A"},"error":null,"meta":{"processing_time_ms":55.1}},
      {"id":"batch-req-2","status":"failed","result":null,"error":"Invalid argument for tool_B","meta":{"processing_time_ms":12.3}},
      {"id":"mcp-req-5","status":"success","result":{"status":"success","output":"Result C"},"error":null,"meta":{"processing_time_ms":150.8}}
    ]
    ```

**Important:** Each complete JSON object (single request/response) or JSON list (batch request/response) MUST be followed by a single newline character (`\n`) to signal the end of the message.

**Example: Calling `get_registered_tools`**

To check which tools the connected MCP agent has available, send the following JSON on stdin:

```json
{
  "id": "my-tool-check-1",
  "tool_name": "get_registered_tools",
  "args": {}
}
```

The agent should respond on stdout with something like:

```json
{
  "id": "my-tool-check-1",
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "status": "success",
    "registered_tools": [
      "save_text",
      "add_numbers",
      "multiply_numbers",
      "echo",
      "get_registered_tools",
      // ... other core tools ...
      "generate_embedding_real", // If OpenAI key and lib available
      "semantic_search_cosine",  // If OpenAI key and libs available
      "clear_embeddings"         // If Faiss lib available
      // ... etc.
    ]
  }
}
```

**Exiting the MCP Agent**

For testing or programmatic shutdown, the MCP agent can be stopped by sending specific commands via stdin:

1.  **Plain Text:** Send the exact string `exit` followed by a newline.
    ```
    exit\n
    ```
2.  **JSON Command:** Send a JSON object containing `"exit": true`.
    ```json
    {"id": "cmd-exit-1", "exit": true}\n
    ```
Upon receiving either of these, the agent will log an exit message and terminate its `run_loop`.

## 4. Environment Considerations

*   **PATH:** Ensure the Python executable path used in the Cursor configuration is correct and points to the one within your activated virtual environment.
*   **Working Directory:** Setting the working directory in Cursor's configuration is vital for the agent to find relative paths (e.g., for `faiss_indices`, data files) correctly.
*   **Permissions:** The user running Cursor must have execute permissions for the Python interpreter and the agent script.
*   **Dependencies:** The environment Cursor launches the agent in must have all necessary Python packages installed.
*   **Tool Limits:** Be mindful of any limitations imposed by the MCP agent itself (e.g., maximum number of registered tools, argument size limits - though typically not strict with stdio).
*   **Logging:** Check the agent's log output (which might appear in Cursor's "Output" panel for the custom tool/LSP) for initialization errors or runtime issues.
*   **Blocking:** Since communication is via stdio, a non-responsive or crashing agent can block Cursor's interaction with it. Ensure the agent script is robust and handles errors gracefully.

## 5. Common Errors and Troubleshooting

When interacting with the MCP agent via stdio (e.g., from Cursor), you might encounter errors. The agent attempts to respond with a JSON error message on stdout:

*   **Invalid JSON Input:**
    *   **Cause:** The data sent to stdin was not valid JSON.
    *   **Example Response:**
        ```json
        {"id": "unknown-request-id", "status": "failed", "error": "Invalid JSON received: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 10 (char 9)"}
        ```
    *   **Solution:** Ensure the client (Cursor) sends correctly formatted, newline-terminated JSON.

*   **Missing `tool_name`:**
    *   **Cause:** The request JSON did not include the required `tool_name` field.
    *   **Example Response:**
        ```json
        {"id": "req-abc", "status": "failed", "error": "Missing 'tool_name' in request"}
        ```
    *   **Solution:** Ensure the `tool_name` field is present in the request.

*   **Invalid `args` or `kwargs`:**
    *   **Cause:** The `args` or `kwargs` field was present but was not a JSON object (dictionary).
    *   **Example Response:**
        ```json
        {"id": "req-xyz", "status": "failed", "error": "'args' must be a dictionary"}
        ```
    *   **Solution:** Ensure `args` and `kwargs` (if provided) are valid JSON objects `{}`.

*   **Tool Not Found:**
    *   **Cause:** The specified `tool_name` is not registered with the agent.
    *   **Example Response (from agent's internal run method):**
        ```json
        {"id": "req-123", "status": "failed", "result": null, "error": "Tool 'unknown_tool' not found."}
        ```
    *   **Solution:** Use `get_registered_tools` to verify the available tool names and ensure correct spelling.

*   **Tool Execution Error:**
    *   **Cause:** An error occurred within the execution of the requested tool itself.
    *   **Example Response (from a tool):**
        ```json
        {"id": "req-456", "status": "failed", "result": null, "error": "Failed to save file: Permission denied."}
        ```
    *   **Solution:** Check the agent's logs (stderr or log file) for more details from the specific tool. Debug the tool's logic.

*   **Agent Crash / No Response:**
    *   **Cause:** A critical error in the MCP agent loop itself, or the agent process was terminated unexpectedly.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Check the terminal where the agent was launched (or Cursor's LSP/Tool output panel) for critical error messages or tracebacks. Ensure dependencies are installed and environment variables (like `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are correctly set if needed.

*   **Invalid Item in Batch:**
    *   **Cause:** An element within a batch request list was not a valid JSON object (dictionary).
    *   **Example Response (within batch list):**
        ```json
        {"id": "mcp-req-1-batch-3", "status": "failed", "result": null, "error": "Invalid item at index 3 in batch request: Expected dict, got str", "meta": {"processing_time_ms": 0.5}}
        ```
    *   **Solution:** Ensure all items in the batch list are valid JSON request objects.

*   **Missing `id` in Batch:**
    *   **Cause:** A batch request list element was missing the required `id` field.
    *   **Example Response (within batch list):**
        ```json
        {"id": "mcp-req-1-batch-3", "status": "failed", "result": null, "error": "Missing 'id' in batch request", "meta": {"processing_time_ms": 0.5}}
        ```
    *   **Solution:** Ensure all batch request elements include a valid `id` field.

*   **Invalid `status` in Batch:**
    *   **Cause:** A batch request list element contained an invalid `status` field.
    *   **Example Response (within batch list):**
        ```json
        {"id": "mcp-req-1-batch-3", "status": "invalid-status", "result": null, "error": "Invalid status format", "meta": {"processing_time_ms": 0.5}}
        ```
    *   **Solution:** Ensure all batch request elements contain a valid `status` field.

*   **Invalid `result` in Batch:**
    *   **Cause:** A batch request list element contained an invalid `result` field.
    *   **Example Response (within batch list):**
        ```json
        {"id": "mcp-req-1-batch-3", "status": "failed", "result": "invalid-result", "error": "Invalid result format", "meta": {"processing_time_ms": 0.5}}
        ```
    *   **Solution:** Ensure all batch request elements contain a valid `result` field.

*   **Invalid `error` in Batch:**
    *   **Cause:** A batch request list element contained an invalid `error` field.
    *   **Example Response (within batch list):**
        ```json
        {"id": "mcp-req-1-batch-3", "status": "failed", "result": null, "error": "Invalid error format", "meta": {"processing_time_ms": 0.5}}
        ```
    *   **Solution:** Ensure all batch request elements contain a valid `error` field.

*   **Invalid `meta` in Batch:**
    *   **Cause:** A batch request list element contained an invalid `meta` field.
    *   **Example Response (within batch list):**
        ```json
        {"id": "mcp-req-1-batch-3", "status": "failed", "result": null, "error": "Invalid meta format", "meta": "invalid-meta"}
        ```
    *   **Solution:** Ensure all batch request elements contain a valid `meta` field.

*   **Tool Execution Timeout:**
    *   **Cause:** The agent took too long to execute a tool.
    *   **Example Response:**
        ```json
        {"id": "req-123", "status": "failed", "result": null, "error": "Tool execution timed out", "meta": {"processing_time_ms": 1000}}
        ```
    *   **Solution:** Check the tool's logic and performance. If it's expected to take a long time, consider increasing the timeout limit in Cursor's configuration.

*   **Network Issues:**
    *   **Cause:** There was a network issue between Cursor and the agent.

## CLI 138 Updates - Latest Features and Enhancements

### New A2A API Batch Endpoints (CLI 137-138)

The Agent Data system now includes powerful batch processing capabilities for high-throughput scenarios:

#### Batch Save Endpoint
```json
POST /batch_save
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "doc_id": "doc1",
      "content": "Document content 1",
      "metadata": {"tags": ["batch", "api"], "source": "a2a"}
    },
    {
      "doc_id": "doc2",
      "content": "Document content 2",
      "metadata": {"tags": ["batch", "processing"], "source": "a2a"}
    }
  ],
  "batch_id": "batch_2024_001"
}
```

#### Batch Query Endpoint
```json
POST /batch_query
{
  "queries": [
    {
      "query": "semantic search query 1",
      "limit": 5,
      "score_threshold": 0.8
    },
    {
      "query": "semantic search query 2",
      "limit": 3,
      "tag_filter": ["specific_tag"]
    }
  ],
  "batch_id": "query_batch_001"
}
```

### Enhanced MCP Tool Registry

The MCP integration now supports additional tools for comprehensive document management:

- `batch_save_documents`: Bulk document storage with vectorization
- `batch_semantic_search`: Multiple queries in a single request
- `get_document_metadata`: Retrieve document metadata and status
- `list_document_tags`: Get available tags for filtering
- `clear_document_cache`: Reset local caches for fresh data

### Performance Optimizations (CLI 138)

- **Selective Test Execution**: `ptfast -m "e2e"` runs 4 E2E tests in <1s
- **Parallel Processing**: Full test suite (337 tests) completes in 2m27s
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent delays to prevent Qdrant free tier limits
- **Batch Processing**: Up to 50 documents or 20 queries per batch request
- **Response Times**: <1s for typical searches, <10s for batch operations

### Updated Environment Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file includes the latest configuration options:

```bash
# Core API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key

# Google Cloud Configuration
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/service_account.json
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=chatgpt-db-project

# Qdrant Configuration
QDRANT_URL=https://ba0aa7ef-be87-47b4-96de-7d36ca4527a8.us-east4-0.aws.cloud.qdrant.io:6333
QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME=agent_data_vectors

# Performance Tuning
QDRANT_BATCH_SIZE=100
QDRANT_SLEEP_DELAY=0.35
API_RATE_LIMIT_BATCH_SAVE=5
API_RATE_LIMIT_BATCH_QUERY=10

# Testing Configuration
PYTEST_PARALLEL_WORKERS=auto
PYTEST_DIST_MODE=worksteal
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### High Test Execution Times
- **Problem**: Full test suite takes too long (>5 minutes)
- **Solution**: Use selective testing with `ptfast -m "e2e"` for development
- **Alternative**: Run specific test files with `pytest tests/test_specific.py`

#### Qdrant Rate Limiting
- **Problem**: Timeout errors or connection failures
- **Solution**: Increase `QDRANT_SLEEP_DELAY` to 0.5s or higher
- **Alternative**: Use batch endpoints to reduce API call frequency

#### MCP Connection Issues
- **Problem**: Cursor cannot connect to MCP server
- **Solution**: Verify Python path and working directory in Cursor settings
- **Check**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed

#### Memory Issues on MacBook M1
- **Problem**: Tests fail with memory errors
- **Solution**: Reduce parallel workers with `pytest -n 4` instead of `auto`
- **Alternative**: Run tests in smaller groups to manage memory usage

### Latest Test Statistics (CLI 138)

- **Total Tests**: 337 (increased from 330 in CLI 137)
- **Pass Rate**: 90.2% (304 passed, 25 skipped, 8 failed)
- **E2E Tests**: 4 tests, <1s execution time
- **API Tests**: 7 new batch endpoint tests added
- **Performance**: All critical paths under performance thresholds

### Nightly CI Configuration

The project includes automated nightly testing via GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/nightly.yml
name: "Nightly Full Test Suite"
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # 2 AM UTC daily
  workflow_dispatch:     # Manual trigger

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run full test suite
        run: python -m pytest tests/ -n auto --dist worksteal --tb=short
```

**Expected Runtime**: <5 minutes for 337 tests on CI runner

### Documentation Validation

The documentation is now validated through automated tests to ensure accuracy and completeness:

```python
# Example test for documentation validation
def test_documentation_sections_exist():
    """Validate that required documentation sections exist."""
    with open('Agent_Data_Final_Report.md', 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()

    required_sections = [
        '## Executive Summary',
        '## Architecture Overview',
        '## API Reference',
        '## MCP Integration Guide',
        '## Deployment Guide'
    ]

    for section in required_sections:
        assert section in content, f"Missing required section: {section}"
```

This ensures documentation stays current with system capabilities and provides reliable guidance for users and developers.
