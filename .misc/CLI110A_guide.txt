CLI110A: Qdrant Snapshot and GCS Upload Implementation Guide

=== IMPLEMENTATION STEPS ===

1. Branch Verification:
   - Checked out cli103a branch
   - Reset to cli109b_all_green commit (0689ae0)
   - Verified starting state with 65/65 tests passing

2. Snapshot Script Creation:
   - Created scripts/qdrant_snapshot.py with comprehensive functionality:
     * get_qdrant_client() - Initialize client with env vars
     * create_snapshot() - Create timestamped snapshots
     * download_snapshot() - Download to temp location
     * upload_to_gcs() - Upload to 'qdrant-snapshots' bucket
     * cleanup_local_file() - Clean up temp files
     * take_and_upload_snapshot() - Main orchestration function
   - Uses environment variables: QDRANT_URL, QDRANT_API_KEY, QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME
   - Organized GCS storage with YYYY/MM/DD folder structure

3. Scheduler Script Creation:
   - Created scripts/schedule_snapshot.sh for cron job execution
   - Includes virtual environment activation
   - Comprehensive logging to logs/snapshot.log
   - Error handling and exit code propagation
   - Made executable with chmod +x

4. Code Quality Verification:
   - Fixed F401 import error (removed unused pathlib.Path)
   - Fixed W293 whitespace errors using sed command
   - Fixed W292 newline at end of file
   - Verified flake8 compliance (no F401/F841 errors)

5. Testing and Validation:
   - Compiled Python script successfully
   - Ran pytest -q: 65/65 tests (63 passed, 2 skipped)
   - Ran fixture drift check: passed (exit 0)
   - All quality gates maintained

6. Git Operations:
   - Added new files to git
   - Committed with detailed message
   - Tagged as cli110a_all_green

=== ISSUES ENCOUNTERED ===

1. Flake8 Style Issues:
   - Issue: Multiple whitespace and import errors
   - Resolution: Removed unused import, used sed to fix whitespace, added newline

2. Git Commit Message:
   - Issue: Newline characters not allowed in command
   - Resolution: Reformatted to single line with dashes

=== RESOLUTIONS ===

1. Environment Configuration:
   - Leveraged existing QDRANT_URL, QDRANT_API_KEY setup from QdrantStore
   - Used QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME with default fallback to "my_collection"

2. GCS Integration:
   - Used existing google-cloud-storage dependency
   - Implemented organized folder structure for snapshots
   - Added comprehensive error handling and verification

3. Logging and Monitoring:
   - Structured logging with timestamps
   - Detailed error reporting with stack traces
   - Return status dictionary for monitoring integration

=== CRON JOB SETUP ===

To schedule snapshots every 6 hours, add to crontab:
```
0 */6 * * * /Users/nmhuyen/Documents/Manual\ Deploy/mpc_back_end_for_agents/scripts/schedule_snapshot.sh
```

=== NEXT STEPS ===

CLI 110B will implement:
- Snapshot restore functionality
- Cloud Run integration for intelligent sync
- Automated sync between Qdrant Cloud and Docker environments
