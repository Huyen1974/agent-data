Purpose: Implemented Cloud Scheduler for hybrid sync between Qdrant Cloud (8h-22h) and Cloud Run (22h-8h)

Total tests: 65/65 (63 passed, 2 skipped)

Summary:
- Deployed Cloud Run service qdrant-agent using simplified approach with pre-built Qdrant image
- Created Cloud Function update_qdrant_env for environment variable switching
- Added Cloud Scheduler jobs to switch between Qdrant Cloud and Cloud Run based on time:
  * switch-to-cloud: Daily at 8 AM (0 8 * * *)
  * switch-to-docker: Daily at 10 PM (0 22 * * *)
- Cloud Run service URL: https://qdrant-agent-pfne2mqwja-uc.a.run.app
- Cloud Function URL: https://us-central1-github-chatgpt-ggcloud.cloudfunctions.net/update_qdrant_env

Infrastructure:
- Cloud Run service: qdrant-agent (region us-central1)
- Cloud Function: update_qdrant_env (region us-central1)
- Cloud Scheduler jobs: switch-to-cloud, switch-to-docker (region asia-northeast1)

Note: Cloud Function has a known issue with service structure that needs to be fixed in CLI 111B.
The scheduler jobs are created and will attempt to call the function, but the environment variable
updates may fail until the service structure is corrected.

Next step: CLI 111B to fix Cloud Function and integrate with Agent Data logic.
