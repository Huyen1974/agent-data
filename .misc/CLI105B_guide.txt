CLI105B Guide: Add Tests for BULK_UPLOAD Endpoint

STEPS TAKEN:
1. Verified branch state: git checkout cli103a && git reset --hard cli105a_all_green
2. Examined existing test structure in tests/api/ directory
3. Read bulk_upload_tool.py to understand the interface and return format
4. Created tests/api/test_bulk_upload.py with 6 comprehensive test cases:
   - test_bulk_upload_valid: Tests successful upload of valid points
   - test_bulk_upload_empty_collection: Tests empty/whitespace collection names
   - test_bulk_upload_empty_points: Tests empty points list
   - test_bulk_upload_invalid_points: Tests points missing vector field
   - test_bulk_upload_mixed_valid_invalid: Tests mix of valid/invalid points
   - test_bulk_upload_with_custom_ids: Tests points with custom IDs
5. Updated tests/test__meta_count.py: EXPECTED_TOTAL_TESTS from 53 to 59
6. Verified tests pass: pytest -q showed 57 passed, 2 skipped
7. Checked F401/F841 compliance: No errors in target directories
8. Verified check-fixture-drift script passes (exit 0)
9. Committed changes: git commit -m "CLI105B: Add tests for BULK_UPLOAD endpoint"
10. Tagged commit: git tag cli105b_all_green

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- None. All tests passed on first run.
- Flake8 showed many errors in other files, but no F401/F841 errors in target directories.

RESOLUTIONS:
- Successfully implemented all required test cases
- All tests pass and maintain existing test infrastructure
- Check-fixture-drift hook continues to pass
- F401/F841 compliance maintained in target directories

FINAL STATUS:
- Total tests: 59/59 (57 passed, 2 skipped)
- All validation checks pass
