CLI 114B5: Small-scale migration of 200 vectors to Qdrant Cloud - SUCCESS
========================================================================

Date: 2025-05-28
Duration: 85.29 seconds
Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL

PURPOSE:
Performed small-scale migration of 200 vectors to Qdrant Cloud to test performance and optimize batch parameters.

TOTAL TESTS: 75/75 (75 passed, 2 skipped)

SUMMARY:
Updated migrate_faiss_to_qdrant.py to migrate 200 vectors with optimized batch settings:
- Batch size: 50 vectors per batch (4 batches total)
- Batch delay: 2.0 seconds between batches (increased from 1.0s for rate-limit mitigation)
- Default limit changed from 100 to 200 vectors
- All 200 vectors uploaded successfully with 100% success rate
- Average time per vector: ~0.43 seconds (improved from CLI 114B4's 0.83s)
- Total migration time: 85.29 seconds
- All operations >5s logged to logs/perf_slow.log
- Migration details logged in logs/migration.log

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Faster per-vector upload time (0.43s vs 0.83s in CLI 114B4)
- Consistent performance across all 4 batches
- 2-second delay between batches effectively mitigated rate-limit issues
- No timeouts or retries needed

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Source: FAISS index "sample_migration_test_cli114b" from GCS
- Target: Qdrant Cloud collection "migrated_vectors"
- Point ID Format: UUID (str(uuid.uuid4()))
- Metadata includes: source_index, vector_index, migration_batch, tag, original_id

VERIFICATION:
✅ All 200 vectors uploaded successfully
✅ pytest -q: 75/75 tests passing (75 passed, 2 skipped)
✅ flake8 compliance: No F401/F841 errors
✅ check_fixture_drift.py: Exit code 0

NOTE: Next step is to test medium-scale migration (1000 vectors) in CLI 114B6.
