CLI140j: Serverless Cost Optimization Guide
=========================================

Objective:
----------
- Reduce serverless costs to <$10/day in dev, <$3/day in production
- Configure min-instances=0, budget alerts, and Log Router
- Ensure all functionalities remain intact

Implementation Steps:
-------------------
1. Cost Audit
   - Review Cloud Billing reports
   - Identify high-cost services
   - Analyze usage patterns

2. Service Configuration
   - Set min-instances=0 for all services
   - Configure Log Router for cost optimization
   - Set up budget alerts

3. Logging Optimization
   - Reduce INFO level logging
   - Configure log retention
   - Set up log routing rules

4. Testing
   - Run cost optimization tests
   - Verify service scaling
   - Validate budget alerts

Verification:
------------
1. Cost Metrics
   - Daily cost <$10 (dev)
   - Daily cost <$3 (production)
   - Monitor via Billing API

2. Configuration
   - All services: min-instances=0
   - Log Router active
   - Budget alerts configured

3. Functionality
   - All tests passing
   - Services scaling properly
   - Logging working as expected

Notes:
------
- Use ptfast for quick tests
- Monitor cost changes
- Keep documentation updated
- Regular cost reviews
