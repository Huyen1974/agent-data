Branch: cli103a
Starting Tag: cli119d7_all_green (commit: 56d0de8)
Ending Tag: cli119d8_all_green
Test Status: 106 passed, 4 skipped (96.4% success rate)

OBJECTIVES COMPLETED:
====================

✅ 1. Complete Cursor integration to enable document storage from IDE prompts
   - Enhanced local_mcp_server.py with handle_cursor_document_storage function
   - Added support for cursor_save_document and save_document_to_qdrant tools
   - Integrated with QdrantVectorizationTool for seamless Qdrant/Firestore sync
   - Metadata enhancement with Cursor-specific information (source, save_directory, integration_type)
   - Tag generation with cursor_{save_dir} pattern for organization
   - JSON format compatibility validated for IDE integration

✅ 2. Deploy API A2A endpoints for agent-to-agent communication
   - Completely rewrote api_mcp_gateway.py using FastAPI framework
   - Implemented /save endpoint for document vectorization and storage
   - Implemented /query endpoint for semantic search on vectorized documents
   - Implemented /search endpoint for tag-based document retrieval
   - Added /health endpoint for service status monitoring
   - Created comprehensive Pydantic models for request/response validation
   - Added CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
   - Integrated with QdrantStore and FirestoreMetadataManager

✅ 3. Implement Firestore security rules for document_metadata and agent_sessions
   - Created firestore.rules with comprehensive security policies
   - Secured document_metadata collection with authentication requirements
   - Secured agent_sessions collection with user-specific access controls
   - Added service account access for chatgpt-db-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   - Implemented data validation functions for document structure
   - Created firebase.json configuration for deployment readiness

✅ 4. Add comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
   - Created tests/api/test_api_a2a_gateway.py with 13 test cases
   - Created tests/api/test_cursor_integration.py with 9 test cases
   - Added tests for all API endpoints (/save, /query, /search, /health)
   - Added tests for Cursor IDE integration scenarios
   - Implemented proper async mocking for FastAPI testing
   - Added Pydantic model validation tests
   - Added integration flow testing for complete A2A workflows

✅ 5. Enhance OpenAPI documentation and schema
   - Created ADK/agent_data/config/openapi_schema.yaml
   - Documented all API endpoints with examples and schemas
   - Added comprehensive request/response models
   - Included production and development server configurations
   - Added example requests for different use cases

⚠️ 6. Deploy alert policy (DEFERRED - metrics propagation pending)
   - Alert policy ready in alert_policy_latency.json
   - Metrics need 10+ minutes to propagate in Cloud Monitoring
   - Deployment command prepared: gcloud alpha monitoring policies create
   - Will auto-deploy in next CLI iteration once metrics are available

✅ 7. Update test count and maintain test suite stability
   - Test count increased from 88 to 110 total tests
   - Success rate improved from 95.5% to 96.4% (106/110 passed)
   - Updated tests/test__meta_count.py with new expected count
   - All new tests passing with proper async handling
