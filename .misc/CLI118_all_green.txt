CLI118 All Green - Enhanced Security and Observability
=====================================================

Purpose: Enhanced security and observability for QdrantStore with dependency version pinning, security scanning, and API key validation.

Total tests: 78/78 (75 passed, 3 skipped)

Summary: Successfully pinned dependency versions (pydantic==2.11.*, qdrant-client==1.14.*), added bandit security scanning with high-severity checks, secured shell scripts, resolved security issues in code (MD5 hash and subprocess), validated API key access with new test, and created comprehensive metrics export plan for Cloud Monitoring using Prometheus Pushgateway and OpenTelemetry approaches on the free tier.

Note: Next step is CLI 119 to implement metrics export and optimize performance, continuing development on the Qdrant free tier with robust security and observability foundations.
