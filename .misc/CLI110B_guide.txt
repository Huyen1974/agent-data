CLI110B Implementation Guide: Snapshot Restore on Cloud Run

=== OVERVIEW ===
This guide documents the implementation of snapshot restore functionality for Cloud Run deployment of Qdrant with automatic GCS snapshot restoration on startup.

=== IMPLEMENTATION STEPS ===

1. Created Snapshot Restore Script (scripts/qdrant_restore.py)
   - Downloads latest snapshot from GCS bucket by creation time
   - Restores snapshot to local Qdrant instance
   - Handles cases where no snapshots exist (graceful skip)
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Clean temporary file management

2. Created Optimized Dockerfile (Dockerfile.qdrant)
   - Multi-stage build for minimal image size (<120 MB target)
   - Stage 1: Build Qdrant binary from source (Rust)
   - Stage 2: Build Python dependencies in virtual environment
   - Stage 3: Final runtime image with Alpine Linux
   - Embedded startup script for Qdrant + restore workflow
   - Health checks and proper signal handling

3. Created Cloud Run Deployment Script (scripts/deploy_cloud_run.sh)
   - Automated gcloud authentication check
   - API enablement (Cloud Build, Cloud Run, Storage)
   - Docker image build and push to GCR
   - Cloud Run service deployment with proper configuration
   - Environment variable setup for GCS integration

=== KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS ===

1. Startup Sequence:
   - Start Qdrant in background
   - Wait for health check (30 second timeout)
   - Run snapshot restore
   - Keep Qdrant running in foreground

2. Error Handling:
   - Graceful degradation when no snapshots exist
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Proper exit codes for container orchestration

3. Resource Configuration:
   - min-instances=0 for cost optimization
   - 2Gi memory, 1 CPU for adequate performance
   - 300 second timeout for startup operations

=== ISSUES ENCOUNTERED AND RESOLUTIONS ===

1. Issue: Dockerfile syntax errors with embedded shell scripts
   Resolution: Used echo commands with >> redirection instead of heredoc syntax

2. Issue: Flake8 whitespace violations in Python script
   Resolution: Used sed to remove trailing whitespace and added proper newline

3. Issue: Docker image size optimization
   Resolution: Multi-stage build with Alpine Linux base and virtual environments

=== TESTING AND VALIDATION ===

1. Python Compilation: ✓ PASSED
   - python -m py_compile scripts/qdrant_restore.py

2. Flake8 Compliance: ✓ PASSED
   - pre-commit run flake8 --files scripts/qdrant_restore.py

3. Test Suite: ✓ PASSED
   - pytest -q: 65/65 (63 passed, 2 skipped)

4. Fixture Drift Check: ✓ PASSED
   - scripts/check_fixture_drift.py: exit 0

=== DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS ===

1. Set environment variables:
   export PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project"
   export QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME="my_collection"
   export GCS_BUCKET_NAME="qdrant-snapshots"

2. Run deployment:
   ./scripts/deploy_cloud_run.sh

3. Verify deployment:
   curl https://SERVICE_URL/health

=== CONFIGURATION OPTIONS ===

Environment Variables:
- QDRANT_URL: Qdrant connection URL (default: http://localhost:6333)
- QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME: Collection to restore (default: my_collection)
- GCS_BUCKET_NAME: GCS bucket for snapshots (default: qdrant-snapshots)
- GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT: GCP project ID

=== MONITORING AND LOGS ===

View Cloud Run logs:
gcloud logs tail --follow --service=qdrant-agent

Key log messages:
- "Starting Qdrant with snapshot restore..."
- "Found latest snapshot: ..."
- "Snapshot restored successfully to collection ..."
- "No snapshot found to restore" (when bucket is empty)

=== NEXT STEPS ===

CLI 111A: Implement Cloud Scheduler for hybrid sync
- Schedule regular snapshots from Cloud Qdrant
- Coordinate with Docker Qdrant restore functionality
- Implement intelligent sync logic between instances
