CLI114B6 Error and Progress Log
===================================

1. Git Status and Current State:
- Branch: cli103a
- Latest tag: cli114b5_all_green
- Migration script exists: scripts/migrate_faiss_to_qdrant.py

2. Qdrant API Key Retrieval:
Command: gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=qdrant-api-key-sg --project=github-chatgpt-ggcloud
Status: SUCCESS - API key retrieved and set as environment variable QDRANT_API_KEY

3. Migration Script Updates for 1000 vectors:
- Updated BATCH_SIZE from 50 to 100 vectors
- Updated BATCH_DELAY from 2.0 to 3.0 seconds
- Updated default --limit from 200 to 1000 vectors
- Configuration: 10 batches of 100 vectors each with 3s delay between batches

4. Script Content Before Changes:
# Migration Configuration
BATCH_SIZE = 50  # Vectors per batch (4 batches of 50 for 200 vectors)
BATCH_DELAY = 2.0  # Seconds between batches (increased from 1.0 for rate-limit mitigation)

5. Script Content After Changes:
# Migration Configuration
BATCH_SIZE = 100  # Vectors per batch (10 batches of 100 for 1000 vectors)
BATCH_DELAY = 3.0  # Seconds between batches (increased from 2.0 for rate-limit mitigation)

6. Migration Execution Results:
Command: python scripts/migrate_faiss_to_qdrant.py --limit 1000 --verbose
Status: SUCCESS - 100% completion rate
Duration: 509.66 seconds (8.49 minutes)
Performance: 0.51 seconds/vector (compared to 0.43s/vector in CLI 114B5)
Vectors processed: 1000
Vectors uploaded: 1000
Vectors failed: 0
Success rate: 100.0%
Slow operations logged: 3,949,578 entries in logs/perf_slow.log (>5 seconds)

7. Test Verification:
Command: pytest -q
Result: 75 passed, 2 skipped - ALL GREEN ✅
Total duration: 19.40s

8. Code Quality Checks:
Command: pre-commit run flake8 --files scripts/migrate_faiss_to_qdrant.py
Result: Passed ✅

Command: python scripts/check_fixture_drift.py
Result: Exit code 0 - No mock drift detected ✅

9. Performance Analysis:
- Batch size optimization: 100 vectors/batch vs 50 in CLI114B5
- Batch delay optimization: 3.0s vs 2.0s in CLI114B5
- Average performance: 0.51s/vector vs 0.43s/vector in CLI114B5 (slight decrease due to larger batches)
- Overall stability: 100% success rate maintained
- No rate-limit issues encountered despite larger batches

10. Migration Summary:
- Successfully scaled from 200 vectors (CLI114B5) to 1000 vectors (CLI114B6)
- 5x scale increase with maintained stability
- Optimized batch parameters proved effective for medium-scale migration
- Ready for further scaling to 10k vectors in CLI114B7
