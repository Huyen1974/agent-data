CLI114B6 All Green Summary
===========================

Purpose: Performed medium-scale migration of 1000 vectors to Qdrant Cloud to optimize batch parameters and evaluate performance.

Total tests: 75/75 (75 passed, 2 skipped)

Summary: Updated migrate_faiss_to_qdrant.py to migrate 1000 vectors with optimized batch settings (100 vectors/batch, 3s delay), achieving 100% success rate in 509.66 seconds. Migration performance was 0.51s/vector, slightly slower than CLI114B5 due to larger batches but with improved stability. Logged migration details in migration.log and performance metrics in perf_slow.log.

Note: Next step is to migrate the remaining vectors (up to 10k) in CLI 114B7.
