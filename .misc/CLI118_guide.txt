CLI118 Guide - Security and Observability Enhancement
====================================================

EXECUTION STEPS:
===============

1. Environment Setup:
   - Verified git state: cli103a branch on cli117_all_green
   - Activated virtual environment with Python 3.10.17
   - Confirmed all dependencies compatible

2. Dependency Version Pinning:
   - Checked current versions: qdrant-client 1.14.2, pydantic 2.11.3
   - Updated requirements.txt with pinned versions:
     * pydantic==2.11.*
     * qdrant-client==1.14.*
   - Added tested-with badge to README

3. Security Scanning Setup:
   - Installed bandit security scanner (1.8.3)
   - Configured .pre-commit-config.yaml with bandit hooks
   - Set to report only high-severity issues
   - Excluded external directories (functions/, containers/, Documents/)

4. Security Issues Resolution:
   - Fixed MD5 hash usage: Added usedforsecurity=False parameter
   - Fixed subprocess security: Removed shell=True, used safer approach
   - Verified shell scripts have appropriate security measures (set -e)

5. API Key Validation:
   - Added test_qdrant_cluster_info() to test_qdrant_integration.py
   - Tests cluster info and collections access
   - Marked as @pytest.mark.slow for appropriate workflow
   - Updated test count from 77 to 78

6. Metrics Export Planning:
   - Created comprehensive plan in .misc/CLI118_metrics_plan.txt
   - Detailed Prometheus Pushgateway approach (preferred)
   - Alternative OpenTelemetry approach
   - Cost considerations for free tier usage

7. Verification:
   - All tests passing: 78/78 (75 passed, 3 skipped)
   - Check-fixture-drift: exit code 0
   - Pre-commit hooks: all passing
   - Bandit: no high-severity security issues

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED & RESOLUTIONS:
=================================

Issue 1: Bandit path handling with spaces
Resolution: Updated exclude patterns and fixed arguments configuration

Issue 2: High-severity security findings
Resolution: Fixed MD5 hash and subprocess security issues in code

Issue 3: Test count mismatch
Resolution: Updated expected count from 77 to 78 after adding API key test

Issue 4: Pre-commit hook configuration
Resolution: Properly configured bandit with high-severity only reporting

DELIVERABLES:
============

- Bandit security scanning integrated
- Code security issues resolved
- Shell scripts security verified

Observability Improvements:
- API key validation test added
