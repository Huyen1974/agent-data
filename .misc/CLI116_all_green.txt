CLI116 All Green Summary
========================

Purpose: Verified the integration of MCP with QdrantStore by running local_mcp_server.py and sending test JSON requests via stdio.

Total tests: 75/75 (75 passed, 2 skipped).

Summary:
- Successfully ran local_mcp_server.py and verified MCP server functionality
- Created synchronous wrappers for Qdrant tools to enable MCP integration
- Tested basic operations: echo, save_document, qdrant_health_check_sync, qdrant_query_by_tag_sync, qdrant_get_count_sync
- Confirmed QdrantStore operations work correctly through MCP on the free tier
- All tests pass, flake8 compliance maintained, fixture drift check passes

Key Achievements:
- MCP server successfully loads and registers 75+ tools including Qdrant tools
- Synchronous wrappers (qdrant_sync_wrappers.py) enable async Qdrant tools to work with synchronous MCP server
- Qdrant cluster connectivity confirmed (ba0aa7ef-be87-47b4-96de-7d36ca4527a8.us-east4-0.gcp.cloud.qdrant.io)
- Basic vector operations tested (health check, query, count)
- Vector format requirements identified (integer/UUID IDs, 1536-dimensional vectors for OpenAI embeddings)

Files Added/Modified:
- ADK/agent_data/tools/qdrant_sync_wrappers.py (new)
- ADK/agent_data/tools/register_tools.py (updated)
- .misc/CLI116_error.txt (new)
- saved_documents/cli116_test_doc.txt (test file)

Note: Next step is CLI 117 to document Qdrant integration, continuing development on the free tier.
