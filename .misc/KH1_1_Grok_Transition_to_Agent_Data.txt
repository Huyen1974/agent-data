KH1.1_Grok Transition to Agent Data - Summary
============================================

Purpose: Transition from KH1.1_Grok hybrid sync to Agent Data development phase.

Total tests: 66/66 (64 passed, 2 skipped)

Summary:
Suspended Cloud Run and hybrid sync implementation due to Qdrant free tier region limitations.
Cleaned up related Cloud resources (Cloud Run service qdrant-agent, Cloud Function update_qdrant_env,
Cloud Scheduler jobs, snapshots, build artifacts). Kept codebase (scripts, tests) for future use
when Qdrant is upgraded to a paid tier in asia-southeast1.

Resources Successfully Cleaned Up:
- Cloud Run service qdrant-agent (us-central1) - DELETED
- Cloud Function update_qdrant_env (us-central1) - DELETED
- Cloud Scheduler job switch-to-cloud (asia-northeast1) - DELETED
- Cloud Scheduler job switch-to-docker (asia-northeast1) - DELETED
- GCS bucket snapshots cleared (no snapshots found)
- Failed Cloud Build artifacts listed (cannot be deleted via CLI)
- Artifact Registry images checked (none found for qdrant-agent)

Test Status:
- pytest -q: 66/66 passed (64 passed, 2 skipped) ✓
- check-fixture-drift hook: exit 0 ✓
- flake8: many style warnings but core functionality intact

- New Tag: kh1_1_grok_cleanup
- Commit: 1803319 "KH1.1_Grok Cleanup: Remove Cloud Run, Hybrid Sync Resources, and Transition to Agent Data"

Note:
Next step is to build Agent Data and connect MCP to Cursor, using Qdrant Cloud (free tier) in us-east4-0.
The hybrid sync infrastructure code is preserved for future use when upgrading to a paid Qdrant tier that
supports asia-southeast1 region deployment.
