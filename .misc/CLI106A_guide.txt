CLI106A Implementation Guide

STEPS TAKEN:
1. Verified branch state: git checkout cli103a && git reset --hard cli105b_all_green
2. Created new search_by_payload_tool.py in ADK/agent_data/tools/
   - Implemented async search_by_payload() function using QdrantClient.scroll with Filter
   - Added synchronous wrapper search_by_payload_sync() for tool registration
   - Used FieldCondition and MatchValue for payload filtering
   - Supports pagination with offset parameter
   - Returns formatted results with status, count, and next_offset
3. Updated register_tools.py to import and register the new tool
   - Added import: from .search_by_payload_tool import search_by_payload_sync
   - Added to local_tools dict: "search_by_payload": search_by_payload_sync
4. Verified implementation with flake8 and pytest
5. Committed changes and tagged as cli106a_all_green

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- None. Implementation went smoothly.

RESOLUTIONS:
- Used QdrantClient.scroll instead of search for payload-only filtering (more efficient)
- Followed existing pattern from delete_by_tag_tool.py for async/sync wrapper
- Maintained consistent error handling and logging

VERIFICATION:
- pre-commit run flake8 --all-files: No F401/F841 errors in target directories
- pytest -q: 57 passed, 2 skipped (59/59 total)
- scripts/check_fixture_drift.py: exit 0 (no drift detected)
- git tag cli106a_all_green: Successfully tagged

ENDPOINT FUNCTIONALITY:
- Searches Qdrant collections by payload fields (tag, content, source, etc.)
- Supports pagination with offset parameter
- Configurable limit, with_payload, with_vectors options
- Returns structured response with status, results, count, next_offset
- Error handling for empty fields and None values
