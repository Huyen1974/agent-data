CLI115B Guide: Update Unit Tests to Mock VectorStore Interface
================================================================

Overview:
--------
CLI 115B updated the unit tests in tests/api/test_embeddings_api.py to mock the VectorStore interface instead of relying on FAISS-specific behavior, ensuring compatibility with QdrantStore.

Steps Taken:
-----------

1. Environment Setup:
   - Verified branch cli103a and reset to cli115a_all_green
   - Activated virtual environment (Python 3.10.17)
   - Confirmed 75/75 tests passing baseline

2. Analysis of Current Test Structure:
   - Examined tests/api/test_embeddings_api.py
   - Identified dependency on QdrantClient-level mocking
   - Found client fixture in tests/conftest.py
   - Analyzed VectorStore interface in ADK/agent_data/vector_store/base.py

3. Implementation of VectorStore Mocking:
   - Created MockVectorStore class implementing VectorStore interface
   - Implemented all required abstract methods:
     * upsert_vector()
     * query_vectors_by_tag()
     * delete_vectors_by_tag()
     * get_vector_count()
     * health_check()
   - Added mock scoring logic for semantic similarity testing
   - Created mock_vector_store fixture

4. Test Updates:
   - Updated setup_qdrant_for_search_tests fixture to use MockVectorStore
   - Modified test_semantic_search_cosine to use VectorStore mocking
   - Modified test_clear_embeddings to use VectorStore mocking
   - Used patch('api_vector_search.get_qdrant_store') to inject mock
   - Maintained existing test logic and assertions

5. Code Quality Fixes:
   - Removed unused imports (AsyncMock, MagicMock)
   - Fixed import order with noqa comments for post-sys.path imports
   - Cleaned up whitespace and formatting
   - Ensured flake8 compliance

6. Verification:
   - All 3 tests in test_embeddings_api.py pass
   - Full test suite: 75 passed, 2 skipped
   - Flake8 compliance achieved
   - Fixture drift check passes

Key Changes:
-----------

1. MockVectorStore Implementation:
   - Generic VectorStore interface implementation
   - No FAISS-specific dependencies
   - Compatible with QdrantStore interface
   - Deterministic mock scoring for consistent test results

2. Test Fixture Updates:
   - Replaced QdrantClient-level mocking with VectorStore-level mocking
   - Cleaner separation of concerns
   - More maintainable test structure

3. Improved Test Isolation:
   - Each test uses its own mock instance
   - Clear data between tests
   - No shared state issues

Benefits:
--------
- Tests are now independent of specific vector store implementation
- Compatible with both FAISS and QdrantStore
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Better test isolation and reliability
- Follows proper mocking patterns

Issues Resolved:
---------------
- Removed FAISS-specific test dependencies
- Fixed flake8 compliance issues
- Improved import organization
- Enhanced test maintainability

Next Steps:
----------
CLI 115B completes the VectorStore interface mocking update. CLI 116 can proceed with MCP integration verification using QdrantStore on the free tier.
