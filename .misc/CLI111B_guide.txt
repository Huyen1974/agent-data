CLI111B Guide: Fix Cloud Function and Integrate with Agent Data Logic

STEPS COMPLETED:
1. Fixed Cloud Function update_qdrant_env by correcting service.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env to service.template.containers[0].env
2. Redeployed Cloud Function successfully
3. Updated Cloud Run service qdrant-agent to use correct service account (chatgpt-deployer@github-chatgpt-ggcloud.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
4. Tested Cloud Function with both "cloud" and "docker" modes - both working correctly
5. Integrated QdrantStore with MCP Server by updating ADK/agent_data/local_mcp_server.py
6. Added handle_qdrant_tool function for upsert_vector and query_vectors_by_tag operations
7. Created integration test tests/api/test_mcp_qdrant_integration.py
8. Fixed asyncio event loop issues in search_by_payload_tool.py
9. Updated test count from 65 to 66 in tests/test__meta_count.py

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
1. Cloud Function "Unknown field for Service: spec" error - Fixed by correcting API path
2. Cloud Run service using wrong service account - Fixed by updating service account
3. Cloud Build quota restrictions in us-central1 - Worked around by updating existing service
4. MCP integration test subprocess issues - Simplified to direct function testing
5. Asyncio event loop closed errors - Fixed by improving event loop handling

RESOLUTIONS:
1. Used correct Cloud Run v2 API structure: service.template.containers[0].env
2. Updated Cloud Run service account to have proper secret access permissions
3. Used gcloud run services update instead of rebuilding from scratch
4. Created direct integration test using handle_qdrant_tool function
5. Improved asyncio handling in search_by_payload_sync wrapper

VERIFICATION:
- Cloud Function working: curl tests successful for both modes
- Tests: 66/66 (64 passed, 2 skipped)
- Flake8: No F401/F841 errors in key directories
- Check-fixture-drift: Passes with exit 0
- Git: Tagged as cli111b_all_green
