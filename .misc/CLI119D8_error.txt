CLI119D8 Error Log - Complete Cursor Integration, Deploy API A2A, Secure Firestore
===============================================================================

Start Time: 2025-01-27 18:30:00 UTC
Branch: cli103a
Starting Tag: cli119d7_all_green (commit: 56d0de8)
Test Status: 84 passed, 4 skipped (95.5% success rate)

IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS:
=======================

[18:30:00] STARTED: CLI119D8 implementation
[18:30:01] INITIALIZED: Error logging and progress tracking
[18:30:02] STATUS: Beginning incremental implementation

ERRORS AND ISSUES:
=================

[18:45:00] ALERT POLICY DEPLOYMENT: Metrics not yet available in Cloud Monitoring
- Error: Cannot find metric(s) that match type = "custom.googleapis.com/qdrant/embedding_generation_duration_seconds"
- Status: Metrics need 10+ minutes to propagate after first export
- Resolution: Alert policy deployment deferred to next CLI iteration

[18:30:15] FIRESTORE RULES DEPLOYMENT: Firebase CLI configuration needed
- Error: Not in a Firebase app directory (could not locate firebase.json)
- Status: Created firebase.json but deployment requires Firebase project initialization
- Resolution: Firestore rules created and ready for deployment

NEXT ACTIONS:
============
1. Enhance Cursor integration in local_mcp_server.py
2. Create API A2A endpoints in api_mcp_gateway.py
3. Implement Firestore security rules
4. Deploy alert policy once metrics are available
5. Add comprehensive tests
