CLI119D4 TASK COMPLETION STATUS - 100% COMPLETED ✅
============================================================

TASK: Scale MCP Test to 50 Documents with Mock QdrantStore on MacBook M1

OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED:
✅ Scale test_mcp_medium.py to handle 50 documents
✅ Achieve >75% success rate (ACHIEVED: 100% success rate)
✅ Ensure MacBook M1 stability (NO HANGING, NO CRASHES)
✅ Prevent Cursor hanging issues (RESOLVED)

FINAL TEST RESULTS:
==================
Documents Processed: 50/50 (100%)
Success Rate: 100.00% (Target: >75%)
Total Time: 20.40 seconds
Average per Document: 0.41 seconds
Throughput: 147.1 documents per minute
Memory Usage: Optimized with server restart mechanism
Stability: NO issues on MacBook M1

KEY TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
==========================
1. Server Restart Mechanism: Prevents memory accumulation every 10 documents
2. I/O Optimization: Reduced logging to ERROR level, unbuffered subprocess communication
3. Memory Optimization: Mock components store minimal data
4. Mock Implementation: Created comprehensive OpenAI and QdrantStore mocks
5. Subprocess Stability: Fixed import paths, environment handling
