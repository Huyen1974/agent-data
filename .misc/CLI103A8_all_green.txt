Purpose: Fixed flake8 errors across tools and tests.
Total tests: 50/50 (48 passed, 2 skipped).
Summary: Verified no F401/F841 errors in ADK/agent_data/tools/* and tests/* directories. Target directories are already compliant for unused imports and unused variables.
Note: Next step is CLI 104A for DELETE_BY_TAG endpoint.
