CLI104A Implementation Guide - DELETE_BY_TAG Endpoint

STEPS TAKEN:
1. Verified branch state: cli103a at commit cli103a8_all_green (fa79b6c)
2. Explored existing codebase structure in ADK/agent_data/tools/
3. Found existing delete_vectors_by_tag method in agent_data/vector_store/qdrant_store.py
4. Created new tool: ADK/agent_data/tools/delete_by_tag_tool.py
   - Implemented async delete_by_tag function using QdrantStore.delete_vectors_by_tag
   - Added synchronous wrapper delete_by_tag_sync for tool registration compatibility
   - Included proper error handling and validation
5. Updated ADK/agent_data/tools/register_tools.py:
   - Added import: from .delete_by_tag_tool import delete_by_tag_sync
   - Added tool registration: "delete_by_tag": delete_by_tag_sync
6. Verified implementation:
   - pre-commit run flake8 --all-files: No F401/F841 errors in target directories
   - pytest -q: 48 passed, 2 skipped (50 total) - maintained test pass rate
   - scripts/check_fixture_drift.py: exit 0 (passed)

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Tool uses existing QdrantStore.delete_vectors_by_tag method
- Leverages Qdrant Filter with FieldCondition for tag matching
- Returns structured response with status, deleted_count, and message/error
- Handles empty/whitespace tags with validation
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- None - implementation was straightforward using existing infrastructure

RESOLUTIONS:
- Successfully implemented DELETE_BY_TAG endpoint
- All tests maintained passing status
- No flake8 F401/F841 violations introduced
- Fixture drift check continues to pass

FINAL STATE:
- Branch: cli103a
- Commit: 42e33ed "CLI104A: Implement DELETE_BY_TAG endpoint"
- Tag: cli104a_all_green
- Tests: 50/50 (48 passed, 2 skipped)
- Flake8: Clean for F401/F841 in target directories
- Fixture drift: Passing (exit 0)
