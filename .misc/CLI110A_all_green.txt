CLI110A: Qdrant Snapshot and GCS Upload Implementation - All Green

Purpose: Implemented Qdrant snapshot creation and upload to GCS bucket 'qdrant-snapshots'

Total tests: 65/65 (63 passed, 2 skipped)

Summary:
- Added scripts/qdrant_snapshot.py for creating timestamped Qdrant snapshots and uploading to GCS
- Added scripts/schedule_snapshot.sh for cron job scheduling every 6 hours
- Snapshot script includes comprehensive error handling, logging, and cleanup
- Uses environment variables QDRANT_URL, QDRANT_API_KEY, QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME
- Uploads to GCS bucket 'qdrant-snapshots' with organized folder structure (YYYY/MM/DD)
- Maintains all existing test compliance and code quality standards
- Fixture drift check passes (exit 0)
- Flake8 compliant (no F401/F841 errors)

Note: Next step is CLI 110B to implement snapshot restore functionality on Cloud Run for intelligent sync between Cloud and Docker environments.
