CLI103A8 Guide: Verify and Fix Flake8 Errors Across Tools and Tests

STEPS EXECUTED:
1. Verified branch state: cli103a at commit d9b4654 (cli103a7_1_all_green tag)
2. Ran pre-commit run flake8 --all-files to identify errors
3. Focused on target directories: ADK/agent_data/tools/* and tests/*
4. Checked specifically for F401 (unused imports) and F841 (unused variables) errors
5. Verified test status: 50/50 tests (48 passed, 2 skipped)
6. Confirmed fixture drift check passes (exit 0)

ISSUES FOUND:
- No F401 or F841 errors in target directories ADK/agent_data/tools/* and tests/*
- Target directories already compliant for unused imports and unused variables
- Other flake8 errors exist (W291, W292, E302, E261, etc.) but not F401/F841

RESOLUTIONS:
- Primary goal achieved: No F401/F841 errors in target directories
- Tests maintain 50/50 pass rate (48 passed, 2 skipped)
- Fixture drift check passes (exit 0)
- No code changes required as target directories are already F401/F841 compliant

VERIFICATION:
- pre-commit run flake8 shows no F401/F841 errors in ADK/agent_data/tools/* and tests/*
- pytest -q shows 48 passed, 2 skipped (50 total)
- scripts/check_fixture_drift.py passes (exit 0)

STATUS: COMPLETE - Target directories are F401/F841 compliant
