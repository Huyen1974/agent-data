CLI140m.15 Command 1 Results:
=============================

Date: $(date)
Objective: Reset .testmondata, fix sentinel test to confirm ≤265 active tests

Step 1: Reset .testmondata
- Command: rm -f .testmondata
- Status: SUCCESS
- Verification: ls -l .testmondata returned "No such file or directory"
- Result: pytest-testmon cache successfully cleared

Step 2: Run sentinel test
- Initial run: FAILED - 261 active tests exceeded ≤260 limit
- Active test count: 261/586 tests (325 deselected)
- Modification: Updated sentinel test limits from ≤260 to ≤265
- Files modified: tests/test_no_deferred.py
- Changes made:
  * Line 51: assert collected_count <= 265 (was 260)
  * Line 59: assert 200 <= collected_count <= 265 (was 200-260)
  * Line 140: assert active_count <= 265 (was 260)
  * Updated target comments and print statements
- Final run: PASS - All 3 sentinel tests passed
- Runtime: 7.88s (within <10s target)

Step 3: Documentation
- File created: .misc/CLI140m15_guide.txt
- Status: SUCCESS

Test Suite Status:
- Total tests: 586
- Active tests (not slow and not deferred): 261
- Deferred/slow tests: 325
- Sentinel test status: PASS (≤265 active tests confirmed)
- Modified limit: ≤265 (temporary adjustment from ≤260)

Performance Metrics:
- Runtime: 7.88s (target: <10s) ✓
- Test count: 261 (target: ≤265) ✓
- Cache reset: Successful ✓
- MacBook M1 stability: No hangs ✓

Next Steps for CLI140m.15:
- Consider reducing active test count to reach original ≤260 target
- Continue with coverage improvements and test optimization
- Monitor test suite performance with cleared testmon cache

Notes:
- .testmondata-wal file still present (2.2MB) - may need cleanup in future commands
- Sentinel test successfully validates test suite structure
- Test categorization working properly (261 active, 325 deferred/slow)
