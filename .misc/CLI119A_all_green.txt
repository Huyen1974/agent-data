CLI119A All Green - Prometheus Pushgateway Implementation
==========================================================

Purpose: Implemented metrics export to Cloud Monitoring using Prometheus Pushgateway for QdrantStore in asia-southeast1.

Total tests: 75/75 (75 passed, 3 skipped)

Summary: Successfully deployed Prometheus Pushgateway on Cloud Run in asia-southeast1, created comprehensive metrics collection system with 8 metric collectors, integrated metrics with QdrantStore operations using MetricsTimer context manager, configured automatic metrics pushing every 60 seconds, and verified end-to-end functionality with all metrics appearing correctly in Pushgateway. Implementation includes connection status monitoring, request timing, error tracking, and business metrics on the free tier.

Note: Next step is CLI 119B to add comprehensive alerting rules and monitoring dashboard, continuing development on the Qdrant free tier with robust observability infrastructure.
