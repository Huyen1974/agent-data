CLI108A Implementation Guide

Steps Taken:
1. Verified branch state: git checkout cli103a && git reset --hard cli107b_all_green
2. Ran drift check: scripts/check_fixture_drift.py --fail-on-drift (passed with exit 0)
3. Created migration_cli.py with FAISS to Qdrant migration functionality
4. Created docs/usage.md with comprehensive migration CLI documentation
5. Fixed flake8 issues: removed unused numpy import, fixed whitespace and newline issues
6. Verified implementation: python -m py_compile migration_cli.py (passed)
7. Verified style: pre-commit run flake8 --files migration_cli.py (passed)
8. Verified tests: pytest -q (64/64 tests, 62 passed, 2 skipped)
9. Verified drift: scripts/check_fixture_drift.py (passed with exit 0)
10. Committed changes: git commit -m "CLI108A: Implement FAISS to Qdrant migration CLI"
11. Tagged milestone: git tag cli108a_all_green

Issues Encountered:
- Initial flake8 failures due to unused numpy import and whitespace issues
- Trailing whitespace and missing newline at end of file

Resolutions:
- Removed unused numpy import from migration_cli.py
- Used sed to remove trailing whitespace: sed -i '' 's/[[:space:]]*$//' migration_cli.py
- Added newline at end of file: echo "" >> migration_cli.py
- All flake8 issues resolved, tests pass, no drift detected

Implementation Details:
- Migration CLI handles both regular FAISS indices and IndexIDMap types
- Processes vectors in configurable batches (default 100)
- Creates points with auto-generated IDs starting from 1
- Adds metadata payload with source, original_index, and tag fields
- Uses QdrantStore class for Qdrant operations
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Command-line interface with argparse for easy usage
