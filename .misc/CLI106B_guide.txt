CLI106B Guide: Adding Tests for SEARCH_BY_PAYLOAD Endpoint

APPROACH:
- Incremental test addition: Added one test at a time, verifying each before proceeding
- Used edit_file tool for creating and modifying test files
- Updated test count in meta_count.py after each test addition

STEPS TAKEN:
1. Verified starting state: 57 passed, 2 skipped (59 total)
2. Created tests/api/test_search_by_payload.py with first test (valid payload search)
3. Updated EXPECTED_TOTAL_TESTS from 59 to 60
4. Verified test passes: 58 passed, 2 skipped (60 total)
5. Added second test (empty field validation)
6. Updated EXPECTED_TOTAL_TESTS from 60 to 61
7. Verified test passes: 59 passed, 2 skipped (61 total)
8. Added third test (None value validation)
9. Updated EXPECTED_TOTAL_TESTS from 61 to 62
10. Verified test passes: 60 passed, 2 skipped (62 total)
11. Added fourth test (pagination with offset)
12. Updated EXPECTED_TOTAL_TESTS from 62 to 63
13. Verified test passes: 61 passed, 2 skipped (63 total)

TESTS IMPLEMENTED:
- test_search_by_payload_valid: Tests valid field/value search with "science" tag
- test_search_by_payload_empty_field: Tests empty field validation
- test_search_by_payload_none_value: Tests None value validation
- test_search_by_payload_pagination: Tests pagination with offset functionality

VERIFICATION:
- All tests pass: 61 passed, 2 skipped (63 total)
- No F401/F841 errors in target directories (ADK/agent_data/tools/* and tests/*)
- Fixture drift check passes (exit 0)
- Successfully committed and tagged as cli106b_all_green

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
- None. All tests passed on first attempt.
- Flake8 shows many style errors in other files, but no F401/F841 in target directories.

TOOLS USED:
- edit_file: Successfully used for creating test file and updating meta count
- search_replace: Successfully used for adding additional tests incrementally
- No need for sed -i as edit_file and search_replace worked perfectly

NEXT STEPS:
- Ready for CLI 107A to implement next feature (e.g., UPDATE_BY_PAYLOAD)
