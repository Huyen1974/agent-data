- ✅ Runtime: All test batches <10s (longest: 5.01s for sentinel)
- ✅ MacBook M1 stability: No hangs, optimal performance
- ✅ Mocking: Complete external service mocking verified

COVERAGE ANALYSIS:
=================
api_mcp_gateway.py Coverage Breakdown:

- ✅ Runtime kept <10s for all operations
- ✅ Used -n 1 for single worker execution
- ✅ No real API calls made during testing
- ✅ .testmondata reset successfully

GAPS ADDRESSED FROM CLI140m.32:
