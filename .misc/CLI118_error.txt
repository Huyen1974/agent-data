PIP SHOW OUTPUT:
===============

pydantic: Version 2.11.3

README BADGE UPDATE:
====================
Added to .cursor/README_TEST_Qdrant_30to50_plan.md:
![Tested With](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested%20with-pydantic%202.11.*%20|%20qdrant--client%201.14.*-green)

PRE-COMMIT CONFIGURATION:
=========================
Updated .pre-commit-config.yaml:
- Added bandit security scanning with high severity checks
- Configured to exclude test directories and external functions
- Fixed bandit configuration for proper path handling

BANDIT INSTALLATION:
===================
Successfully installed bandit-1.8.3 and dependencies:
- markdown-it-py-3.0.0
- mdurl-0.1.2
- pbr-6.1.1
- pygments-2.19.1
- rich-14.0.0
- stevedore-5.4.1

SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED:
========================
1. Fixed MD5 hash usage in test_insert_and_query.py:
   Changed: hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
   To: hashlib.md5(text.encode(), usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()

2. Fixed subprocess security in tests/test__meta_count.py:
   Removed shell=True and implemented safer subprocess approach
   Using: subprocess.run(['pytest', '--collect-only', '-q'], ...)

3. Configured bandit to exclude external directories:
   Excludes: functions/, containers/, Documents/, tests/, .cursor/

SHELL SCRIPT SECURITY REVIEW:
=============================
Checked key scripts - all have appropriate security measures:
- scripts/run_drift_check.sh: Simple, secure
- scripts/deploy_cloud_run.sh: Uses 'set -e', no debug logging
- scripts/deploy_cloud_run_simple.sh: Uses 'set -e', no debug logging

API KEY VALIDATION TEST:
=======================
Added test_qdrant_cluster_info() to tests/api/test_qdrant_integration.py:
- Tests cluster info access to validate API key
- Tests collections list access
- Marked as @pytest.mark.slow for slow-tests workflow
- Properly handles ImportError and configuration validation

METRICS EXPORT PLAN:
====================
Created .misc/CLI118_metrics_plan.txt with detailed plan for:
- Prometheus Pushgateway integration (preferred approach)
- OpenTelemetry alternative
- Metrics to export (requests, duration, errors, etc.)
- Cost considerations for free tier
- Implementation phases for CLI 119+

TEST RESULTS:
============
Test count updated from 77 to 78 (added API key validation test)
Final results: 75 passed, 3 skipped in 15.34s

CHECK-FIXTURE-DRIFT RESULTS:
============================
Script executed successfully with exit code 0
Warnings about mock methods (expected - these are intentional mock extensions)
No mock drift detected

PRE-COMMIT RESULTS:
==================
- bandit: Passed (no high-severity issues)
- Python compile: Passed
- Check fixture drift: Passed

FILES UPDATED:
=============
- requirements.txt (pinned versions)
- .cursor/README_TEST_Qdrant_30to50_plan.md (added badge)
- .pre-commit-config.yaml (added bandit, security config)
- test_insert_and_query.py (fixed MD5 security issue)
- tests/test__meta_count.py (fixed subprocess security, updated count)
- tests/api/test_qdrant_integration.py (added API key validation test)
- .misc/CLI118_metrics_plan.txt (created metrics export plan)

ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION:
