## Migration Log Analysis
- Total vectors attempted: 10,000
- Successful uploads: 0
- Failed uploads: 7,748 (partial count due to interruption)
- Error pattern: "Format error in JSON body: value sample_vector_XXXXXX is not a valid point ID, valid values are either an unsigned integer or a UUID"

## Root Cause
Qdrant requires point IDs to be either:
1. Unsigned integers (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
2. UUIDs (e.g., "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000")

Our current implementation uses string IDs like "sample_vector_000000" which are invalid.

## Solution Strategy
1. Update migration script to use integer IDs instead of string IDs
2. Add proper timeout and retry logic for connection issues
3. Add UUID generation as fallback option
4. Maintain existing logging and performance monitoring

## Script Changes Required
- Convert vector IDs from strings to integers
- Add asyncio.timeout for vector upload operations
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Improve error handling and connection management

## Performance Monitoring
- logs/perf_slow.log: Contains slow operations >5s
- logs/migration.log: Contains detailed upload status for each vector
- Need to ensure proper cleanup and connection closure

## Next Steps
1. Fix point ID format issue
2. Add timeout and retry logic
3. Re-run migration with improved script
4. Verify all 10k vectors are uploaded successfully
