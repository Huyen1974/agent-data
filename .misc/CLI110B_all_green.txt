CLI110B: Implement Snapshot Restore on Cloud Run - COMPLETED

Purpose: Implemented snapshot restore functionality for Cloud Run (Docker Qdrant) startup, downloading the latest snapshot from GCS and restoring it.

Total tests: 65/65 (63 passed, 2 skipped)
Check-fixture-drift: PASSED (exit 0)
Flake8 compliance: PASSED (no F401/F841 errors)

Summary:
- Added scripts/qdrant_restore.py for downloading and restoring snapshots from GCS
- Created optimized Dockerfile.qdrant for Cloud Run deployment (<120 MB target)
- Added scripts/deploy_cloud_run.sh for automated Cloud Run deployment
- Implemented multi-stage Docker build with Qdrant binary and Python dependencies
- Added startup script that waits for Qdrant, then runs snapshot restore
- Configured min-instances=0 for cost optimization
- Maintained all existing test coverage and compliance

Key Features:
- Automatic snapshot discovery (finds latest by creation time)
- Graceful handling when no snapshots exist (skipped status)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Clean temporary file management
- Health checks and startup verification
- Environment variable configuration

Files Added:
- scripts/qdrant_restore.py (224 lines)
- Dockerfile.qdrant (131 lines)
- scripts/deploy_cloud_run.sh (92 lines)

Git Status:
- Commit: d883ad1
- Tag: cli110b_all_green
- Branch: cli103a

Note: Next step is CLI 111A to implement Cloud Scheduler for hybrid sync between Cloud and Docker instances.
