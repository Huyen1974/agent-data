CLI112D: Add Missing Documentation Files from CLI 112 - GUIDE
================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Add the missing documentation files from CLI 112A, 112B, and 112C to git and update their respective tags to ensure a complete commit history.

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The documentation files from CLI 112A, 112B, and 112C (.misc/CLI112[A,B,C]_*.txt) were not committed to git, making their respective tags incomplete.

APPROACH:
1. Verified current state on cli103a branch where all files exist
2. Copied all CLI112 documentation files to temporary location (/tmp/cli112_docs/)
3. Systematically fixed each CLI tag by:
   - Checking out the specific tag
   - Copying missing documentation files
   - Adding files to git
   - Committing changes
   - Updating the tag to point to new commit

EXECUTION STEPS:
1. CLI112A: Added 3 missing files (all_green.txt, guide.txt, error.txt)
2. CLI112B: Added 2 missing files (all_green.txt, guide.txt) - error.txt already existed
3. CLI112C: Added 3 missing files (all_green.txt, guide.txt, error.txt)

VERIFICATION:
- Tests: 75/75 passed (75 passed, 2 skipped)
- Fixture drift check: PASSED (exit 0)
- All CLI112 tags now include complete documentation

ISSUES RESOLVED:
- Incomplete git history for CLI 112A, 112B, 112C tags
- Missing documentation files that were created but not committed

NEXT STEPS:
Ready to proceed with CLI 113B to integrate QdrantStore with ToolsManager.
