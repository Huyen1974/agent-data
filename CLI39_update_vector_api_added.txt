CLI39: /update_vector API endpoint and Pydantic models (UpdateVectorRequest, UpdateVectorResponse) added to api_vector_search.py.
Unit tests for this endpoint were added to test_api_vector_search.py, covering success, validation errors, and store error scenarios.

NOTE: The test suite (test_api_vector_search.py) is currently experiencing issues with how `await` interacts with mocked asynchronous methods of QdrantStore within the TestClient environment. This leads to some existing tests failing and affects the reliability of new async error path tests. Specifically, `await` on a mocked async method call appears to return the coroutine/mock object itself rather than its configured result (return_value or side_effect). This causes unexpected behavior in endpoints relying on the direct outcome of these awaited calls (e.g., truthiness evaluation or Pydantic model validation with return values).

Further investigation into the test environment's asyncio handling (possibly related to unittest.TestCase + TestClient + pytest-asyncio interactions) is required to fully stabilize the test suite.
