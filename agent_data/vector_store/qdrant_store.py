        Asynchronously retrieve point records (containing IDs) by a specific tag using scroll.
        Primarily used to get IDs for batch operations.

        Args:
            tag: The tag to filter by.
            limit: The maximum number of records to return in one scroll request.
            offset: Optional scroll ID to continue scrolling from a previous request.
                    Qdrant's offset for scroll is typically the `next_page_offset` from a previous scroll result.
                    If starting a new scroll, this should be None or 0.
            with_payload: Whether to include the payload in the results.
