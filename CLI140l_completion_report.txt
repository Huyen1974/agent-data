- **Performance tests dominate runtime** (93% of total time)
- **Clean environment overhead** is reasonable (47.63s vs cached)
- **Target is achievable** with minimal variance

### Future Considerations
1. **Target Adjustment**: Consider 320s target to account for CI variance
2. **Performance Optimization**: Investigate top performance test optimizations
3. **CI Integration**: Implement nightly simulation in CI pipeline
4. **Monitoring**: Track nightly CI runtime trends over time

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues
1. **Runtime Variance**: Expect ±10-30s variation due to network conditions
2. **Test Failures**: 40 failed tests are known issues, not simulation problems
3. **Environment Setup**: Ensure complete cache clearing for accurate simulation
4. **Rate Limiting**: Performance tests may hit API rate limits (expected)

### Performance Debugging
1. **Use --durations=10**: Identify slowest tests in simulation
2. **Monitor Network**: Check external service availability and response times
3. **Validate Environment**: Ensure CI variables are properly set
4. **Compare Modes**: Use mock mode for development, simulation for validation
